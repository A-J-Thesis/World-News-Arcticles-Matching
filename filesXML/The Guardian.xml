Foreign Office advises Britons to leave Tunisia in wake of attack
Official advice suggests a further terrorist attack is highly likely and warns against all but essential travel to the country
Foreign secretary Philip Hammond advises British tourists to leave Tunisia immediately.

British tourists are being advised to leave Tunisia immediately after intelligence warnings of further terrorist attacks and concerns that the local authorities are unable to provide adequate protection.
Tour operators are organising extra flights to bring back more than 3,000 UK tourists after the Foreign Office amended its travel advice to warn against all but essential travel to the country.

Thomas Cook, Thomson and First Choice announced they have cancelled outbound flights to Tunisia for the summer season, up to and including 31 October. Thomas Cook has chartered extra flights  in addition to its own 10 scheduled flights over the weekend  to repatriate its holidaymakers. Thomson and First Choice currently have no customers in Tunisia but will repatriate all their staff from the country within the next 24 hours.
Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, told the BBC that the FCO travel advice had been amended amid fears that a further terrorist attack was highly likely. While we do not have any information suggesting a specific or imminent threat, since the attack in Sousse the intelligence and threat picture has developed considerably, leading us to the view that a further terrorist attack is highly likely.
The Tunisian investigation into those behind the Sousse attack, and that on the Bardo Museum earlier this year, is on-going and the Tunisians have made clear they want to track down further individuals who they suspect may have links to this attack.
Furthermore, we have now completed an assessment of the security measures in tourist areas and while we are working with the Tunisian authorities to further strengthen those measures, we judge that more work is needed to effectively protect tourists from the terrorist threat.
Taking all these factors together, we judge that it is right and prudent to make this change today.
British officials hope that extra flights laid on by tour operators will mean the estimated 2,500 to 3,000 UK tourists on package holidays in the country will be flown home within the next two to three days. The Foreign Office is also reaching out to the estimated 300 British tourists travelling independently in Tunisia with advice for them to return home on scheduled flights or on the extra flights organised by the tour operators. There were 20,000 British tourists in Tunisia at the time of the gun attack in Sousse last month, which claimed the lives of 38 holidaymakers, of whom 30 were British.
The foreign secretary interrupted negotiations in Vienna on Irans nuclear programme on Thursday afternoon to telephone the Tunisian prime minister, Habib Essid, to inform him of what is being described as a serious upgrade of the UKs travel advice. Essid warned on Wednesday of further attacks and Britains intelligence agencies are advising that such attacks are highly likely.
In a statement on its website , the FCO said the British authorities have been working closely with the Tunisian authorities since the Sousse gun attack. But the FCO said it feared a further attack and had concerns about security measures in place to protect tourists.
The travel advice says: Since the attack in Sousse, we have been working closely with the Tunisian authorities to investigate the attack and the wider threat from terrorist groups in Tunisia. Although we have had good cooperation from the Tunisian government, including putting in place additional security measures, the intelligence and threat picture has developed considerably, reinforcing our view that a further terrorist attack is highly likely.
On balance, we do not believe the mitigation measures in place provide adequate protection for British tourists in Tunisia at the present time and we have therefore changed our travel advice accordingly.
The advice is against all but essential travel to the whole of the country, which means tourists should leave immediately and those with holidays booked should avoid Tunisia. The FCO said: If youre in Tunisia and you dont have an essential need to remain you should leave by commercial means. Tour operators are arranging additional flights and will be organising departures for their customers. If youre travelling with a tour operator, you should contact your tour operators representative in the first instance.
If youre travelling independently, you should make your own arrangements to leave. Commercial airlines are operating.
Nikhil Patel, 18, from Luton, arrived in a seaside town to the south of the capital, Tunis, on Wednesday morning. He is staying in a hotel, along with a host of other British tourists, on a two-week holiday.
He said: Everything is fine so far because the security is very high. I spend all day on the beach and you see police officers walking around with guns, keeping an eye on everything. Even the locals are on full alert.
He said he had just seen the FCO advice on the news but he planned to stay until his travel firm advised him to leave. I am making the most of it because I get the feeling we might be leaving.
At the British embassy in Tunis, a spokesman said that fewer than 3,000 British tourists are in Tunisia, the vast majority of them on holidays organised by Thomas Cook.
The Imperial Marhaba hotel, scene of the attack last month, had as guests British visitors on packages booked with Tuis Thomson and First Choice brands. These companies at present have no British customers in the country, the spokesman said.
The change to the travel advice comes as the UK authorities now have better access to intelligence gathered by the Tunisian security services, he added.
The FCO added: Further terrorist attacks are highly likely, including in tourist resorts, and by individuals unknown to the authorities whose actions may be inspired by terrorist groups via social media. You should be especially vigilant at this time and follow the advice of the Tunisian security authorities and your tour operator, if you have one.

There is a high threat from terrorism in Tunisia. On 4 July the Tunisian government announced it was reinstating the state of emergency , lifted in 2014, as part of its continuing response to the recent terrorist attacks. On 8 July the Tunisian prime minister stated publicly that further attacks were likely. The Tunisian authorities have increased their security measures but have also acknowledged the limitations in their ability to counter the current terrorist threat.
In its statement the FCO also advised against all travel to:
The Tunisia-Algeria border crossing points at Ghardimaou, Hazoua and Sakiet Sidi Youssef.
The militarised zone south of, but not including, the towns of El Borma and Dehiba.
Within 5km of the Libya border area from north of Dehiba, up to but not including the Ras Ajdir border crossing.
It is understood that the Tunisian prime minister understood Britains decision to upgrade its travel advice. In his telephone conversation with Essid, Hammond praised Tunisias response to the Sousse attack, which involved a noticeable increase in security forces in popular tourist areas. But Britain believes that the Tunisian authorities have some way to go to provide security which would allow tourists to remain in the country in safety.

        <title>Greek debt crisis: 'Of all the damage, healthcare has been hit the worst'</title>

Above a dark, tatty arcade of wholesale button traders and empty shop fronts in Thessaloniki, Greeces second largest city, one mother was rocking a sick baby and another was carrying a toddler as they waited to see a volunteer paediatrician in the brightly painted clinic run by the Greek branch of the NGO Doctors of the World .
Were already facing a humanitarian crisis in Greece , said Sofia Garane who runs the clinic. Of all the damage done during the last five years, healthcare has been hit the worst.
The Greek healthcare system is in meltdown after years of austerity. State-run hospitals have had to slash budgets but as much as 50% in that time. Basic supplies such as gloves, syringes, gauze, cotton wool, catheters and paper towels have long been in low supply. The numbers of doctors and nurses is critically low.
Rising poverty and rocketing unemployment has left 2.5 million Greeks  a quarter of the population  without national state healthcare coverage (Health benefits are only available for up to a year after losing a job, after which patients must pay for their own treatment). Screening for diseases such as uterus, breast and prostate cancers have been reduced, and with struggling patients unable to seek out primary care, patients are arriving for treatment at late stages when serious conditions have already taken hold.

The local doctors, ranging from urologists and cardiologists to paediatric surgeons, take turns to work for free at the Thessaloniki clinic that is on the frontline of in the medical solidarity movement which is keeping healthcare afloat. Five years ago, most of the patients at this clinic were refugees or other foreign nationals with no access to healthcare. Now, the 1,500 patients who come each month are largely Greeks, many of whom once ran businesses or shops in the city but who are now unemployed and with no healthcare access. Over the past three years, the number of patients arriving to see the clinics volunteer psychologist and psychiatrist has doubled.
In the two weeks since Greek banks were frozen and cashpoint withdrawals limited to 60 a day with pensions limited to 120 a week, Garane said more and more people who should have state health coverage had come to the clinic for help.

Because of the crisis of the past few days, they cant find their medicines, such as diabetes or blood pressure drugs, or have no money to pay for the percentage of the cost that they have to meet upfront. Stress levels are rising, people are very upset and tense. They now feel afraid. Hope is important and people dont want to lose their hope for the future, she said.

Dr Dimitris Adamidis runs the paediatric department at the general hospital in Xanthi, a north-eastern city in a region with some of the countrys highest poverty rates. He knows firsthand the dangers of budget cuts. In 2011, at the height of the Greek financial crisis, he found a series of problems with the new cheaper umbilical cord clamps that were being used at the hospital, that cost 10 cents each less than the previous ones.
I researched several problems with them. One newborn had terrible bleeding as a result of it but fortunately we saved him after two weeks in neonatal intensive care. When Adamidis blew the whistle on the problems, his job was threatened and he was sued by the state, a legal battle which he eventually won this year. Im not against cheap materials but they have to be absolutely safe, he said.
In a country which has seen a rise in diseases such as TB and malaria during the crisis years, childrens health has suffered. In Xanthi, Adamidis sees effects on those whose families sleep rough and has seen a rise in both child obesity, because families eat cheap junk-food, and the chronically underweight because there is little food to go round. Five years ago, there were five paediatricians on his unit. Now there are two.
There has been a tremendous effort to put the needs of patients first, but now there are signs of burnout in doctors, he said. I recently broke my leg and needed to be operated on. My surgeon, who was excellent, started his operating shift at 8am and continued through to 10pm.
Run-down state hospitals often make work even harder. A Greek lawyer who had recent abdominal surgery, said: There were three beds in my room but they couldnt have anyone in the middle bed because the ceiling was falling in over it, and yet the staff were amazing.

Dr Dimitris Adamidis
When he was elected in January, the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras , promised to hire 4,500 healthcare workers and fight what he called the barbaric conditions in public hospitals and corruption in the health sector. As Greece awaits the conditions of any new bailout deal, medical staff hope the extreme problems of the health sector will be addressed.
Dr Pantelis Vakianis is a nephrologist who runs a private dialysis clinic in Thessaloniki which has contracts from the state. He said he had enough medical supplies and medicines for about two to three months, but the state was behind in payments for many doctors and staff salaries had been cut.
Vakianis said he felt recent years had seen the gradual destruction of the public health system, followed by the private system. Weve been slowly heading towards a humanitarian crisis, he warned.
In a pharmacy on a quiet street in Thessaloniki a young chemist was trying to reassure his elderly customers as stress levels ran high. A pensioner on painkillers had run up credit as she did not have enough cash. Others, fearing the uncertainty of when a political deal could be done and when banks would reopen, wanted to buy extra of their prescription medicines ranging from diabetes drugs to antidepressants. After almost two weeks of a Greek bank freeze that has banned money from being transferred abroad, there has been concern that imported drugs  whose supply chain has already been badly disrupted during Greeces five-year debt crisis  could be hit. Pharmacists have long been struggling with delays in reimbursements from the state, difficulties sourcing drugs and a lack of funds.
Ive got enough medicines in stock for at least a couple of weeks and Im trying to calm people down, the pharmacist said. Customers are worried that there might be shortages of things like insulin and painkillers, a lot of women have come in concerned they might not find enough of their birth-control pills and contraceptives. Its very upsetting but my message to customers is: Dont panic. Well get you your medicines. Well do everything we can. Right now my stocks are ok, but if this carries on, in a few weeks it will get difficult.

        <title>Syrian refugees: four million people forced to flee as crisis deepens</title>

The conflict in Syria has now driven more than four million people  a sixth of the population  to seek sanctuary in neighbouring countries, making it the largest refugee crisis for a quarter of a century, according to the UN.
On Thursday, the UN refugee agency, UNHCR , said the total number of Syrian refugees in Turkey , Lebanon , Iraq , Jordan , Egypt and other parts of north Africa stood at 4,013,000 people.
With at least 7.6 million people forced from their homes within Syria , almost half the countrys people are either refugees or internally displaced. The conflict, now in its fifth year, has killed more than 220,000 people.

Antnio Guterres, the UN high commissioner for refugees, said the exodus was the biggest refugee population from a single conflict in a generation and called on the international community to step up.
He said: It is a population that needs the support of the world but is instead living in dire conditions and sinking deeper into poverty.
Worsening conditions are driving growing numbers towards Europe and further afield, but the overwhelming majority remain in the region. We cannot afford to let them and the communities hosting them slide further into desperation.
Turkey is now the largest refugee-hosting country in the world, sheltering 1,805,255 Syrians. Lebanon has taken in 1,172,735 Syrian refugees, Jordan 629,128, Iraq 249,726 and Egypt 132,375. About 24,055 Syrians are refugees elsewhere in north Africa. The latest UN figures do not include the more than 270,000 Syrians applying for asylum in Europe, nor the thousands resettled from the region elsewhere.
Refugee hosting countries
The milestone of four million comes just 10 months after the number of Syrian refugees hit three million, and the UN predicts there will be 4.27 million in the region by the end of this year. At the end of 2014, one in every five displaced people worldwide was Syrian.
Despite being the worlds single largest refugee crisis, the number of people fleeing is still far lower than the number of Afghans who were forced from their country following the Soviet withdrawal. According to the UNHCR, there were 6.3 million Afghans living in Pakistan and Iran in 1990 .

The sheer number of Syrian refugees that have fled the war in their homeland is putting the international humanitarian system under huge financial strain.
At the end of June, UN aid agencies warned that a $5.5bn (3.6bn) appeal to tackle the Syrian refugee crisis this year was less than 25% funded , putting millions of vulnerable people at risk  a situation that has already led to cuts in vital assistance.
Last week, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) warned once again that it was running out of money to feed the refugees and could be forced to cut all help for the hundreds of thousands of Syrians in Jordan as soon as next month.
Muhannad Hadi, the WFPs regional director for the Middle East, north Africa, central Asia and eastern Europe, said: Just when we thought things couldnt get worse, we are forced yet again to make yet more cuts.
 Refugees were already struggling to cope with what little we could provide.
According to the agencies and their partner organisations, the shortfall has meant 1.6 million refugees have already had food assistance cut this year and 750,000 children are not attending school.

Most of Syrias refugees have no prospect of returning home in the near future amid a conflict that has become increasingly complex and intractable.
In the north and north-east, Kurdish militias are fighting Islamic State in see-saw battles that continue to drive civilians across the border into Turkey. Turkeys reluctance to absorb more refugees often leaves people stranded for days at the border.
In Aleppo and Daraa, two of Syrias largest cities, rebels fighting the regime of the president, Bashar al-Assad , have pressed on with offensives that have encountered stiff resistance from loyalist troops, stalling the attacks.
But even if they were to seize the coveted territory, or begin an assault on the capital, Damascus, the country would be faced with the collapse of state institutions and services as the opposition attempts to manage a large metropolis such as Aleppo under unforgiving air strikes.
The regimes collapse there would likely drive more refugees into neighbouring states, particularly Lebanon, where displaced Syrians already make up a fifth of the population, upsetting the delicate sectarian balance and stretching infrastructure past its breaking point. Lebanon has responded with increasingly stringent entry conditions.
Assads government and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah are fighting to secure the border region that straddles the two countries after a series of defeats that exposed the growing fragility of the Syrian army.
A recent global trends study by the UNHCR found that the level of worldwide displacement is higher than ever before, with a record 59.5 million people living exiled from their homes at the end of 2014.
The UNHCR estimates that an average of 42,500 men, women and children became refugees , asylum seekers or internally displaced people every day last year  a fourfold increase in just four years.
By the end of last year, there were 19.5 million refugees  more than half of them children  as well as 38.2 million internally displaced people and 1.8 million asylum seekers.
With war, violence and persecution leaving one in every 122 humans on the planet a refugee, internally displaced or seeking asylum at the end of 2014, the UNHCR warned that the world was experiencing an  age of unprecedented mass displacement .
Decades of displacement
According to UNHCR, there were 6.3 million Afghans living in Pakistan and Iran in 1990 following the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan.
The Bosnian war of 1992-1995 forced 2.7 million people to flee, making it it the largest displacement of people in Europe since the second world war.
Following the Rwandan genocide in 1994, two million people fled to neighbouring countries. The refugees, who were mainly Hutus, sought refuge in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), Tanzania, Burundi and Uganda.
In 1999, more than 867,000 people fled the war in Kosovo , most of them heading to Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia.
The 2003 US invasion of Iraq and the violence that followed is estimated to have pushed about two million Iraqis into countries including Syria, Jordan, Egypt and Lebanon.

The US secretary of state was speaking a few hours before a deadline set by the US Congress to complete long-running negotiations with Iran on the future of its nuclear programme. Failure to meet the target of midnight Washington time will mean that the legislature has two months instead of one to review any agreement, giving time for its opponents to rally .
Diplomats in Vienna said the extension would not be fatal to the negotiations, which have already gone past several previous self-imposed deadlines.
Talking to reporters outside the Vienna hotel venue for the talks, Kerry said: We shouldnt give up and leave because the clock strikes midnight  We will not be rushed. But in the same remarks, Kerry insisted that the talks were not open-ended and said Barack Obama had told him his negotiating team could not stay there forever.
Just before Kerry spoke, the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, emerged from the same hotel to declare that the last hundred metres of a marathon were the hardest.
There are difficult points that remain, but things are all the same going in the right direction, Fabius told reporters. Due to these conditions, I have decided to stay and work tonight and tomorrow morning. I hope we will be able to complete the metres that need to be run. There are good things, but there are difficult things that still need to be worked on.
His Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, broadcast a similar message of determination to stay at the negotiating table. Were working hard, but not rushed, to get the job done. Mark my words; you cant change horses in the middle of a stream, the foreign minister tweeted.
 Javad Zarif (@JZarif) July 9, 2015

The horse reference appeared to refer to Iranian perceptions that a package offered on Wednesday by the US had been withdrawn after a video conference on Wednesday night between the US negotiating team and Obama.
Diplomats said that some of the most heated arguments this week have been over the question of whether the UN arms embargo on Iran should be lifted along with economic and financial restrictions in return for accepting curbs on its nuclear programme.
The debate split the six-nation group negotiating with Iran, with Russia and China siding with Iran against the US, UK, France and Germany. The arms embargo on Iran must be one of the first sanctions to be lifted  Especially since Iran is persistently supporting the fight against Isis [Islamic State] and the elimination of this threat in the region, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said, according to tweets from his ministry. Lavrov said he expected to return to the talks late on Thursday or early Friday.
The UK foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, and the German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, are also in Vienna and expected to stay for late-night talks on Thursday.
The arms embargo row came to a head on Tuesday when the EU foreign policy chief, Frederica Mogherini, reportedly threatened to return to Brussels if there was not greater flexibility from the Iranians. Her Iranian counterpart Zarif is said to have replied: Go if you wish. But do not threaten an Iranian. Lavrov chimed in: Do not threaten a Russian either.
At another point in the talks, Zarif said he could take his interlocutors to international court for the wests support of Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s.
Diplomats said the row was soothed relatively quickly. Zarif invited Mogherini to a Persian meal on Wednesday evening. However, the air conditioning in the hotel where the talks are being held suffered a breakdown, ratcheting up the tension and discomfort of marathon negotiating sessions.

An Israeli man has been missing in Gaza for almost 10 months  presumed held captive by Hamas  after climbing over a border fence from a public beach adjoining the coastal strip. He is one of two Israeli citizens held alive in Gaza .
The case of Avera Mengistu, 28, an Israeli-Ethiopian, was revealed on Thursday morning after a court lifted a gag order that has been in force since his disappearance.
The second captive is a Bedouin man from Israels Negev desert. Israeli officials refused to say how long he had been held in Gaza or how he got there. They also would not say which group had him in custody.
The disappearance of Mengistu was revealed after the Israeli newspaper Haaretz challenged the order and had it lifted. According to the newspaper , Mengistus family has been deeply critical of the Israeli governments allegedly low-key handling of his case, saying the matter would have been handled differently if he was white.
It said the family had not met with the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, and he had not responded to a letter the family sent to him requesting help. A senior Israeli defence official quoted in the Hebrew media said there was no current information on Mengistus fate, but that he had initially been arrested by Hamas.

Hamas is also holding the bodies of two soldiers killed during last summers Gaza war  Oron Shaul and Hadar Goldin.
Mengistu, from the coastal city of Ashkelon, had apparently suffered mental health problems in the past and is believed to have been drinking on the day of his disappearance, when he climbed over a fence on Zikkim beach, adjoining Gaza.
On the day he disappeared, Israeli military surveillance cameras spotted a man carrying a bag approaching the fence, who the camera operators believed was a Palestinian returning to Gaza. When soldiers, alerted to the figure, arrived, he had already climbed the fence leaving behind the bag, which contained a copy of the Hebrew Bible inside. It was at this point they realised he was Israeli.

Security footage seen by Mengistus family apparently showed him walking calmly towards the fence, which he climbed over before approaching a tent on the other side.
Speaking to Haaretz, Mengistus brother Yalo explained why the family had supported efforts to publicise the case. We are fed up. We want to go public with his story. The day it happened, a person from the Shin Bet security service or the police called me and said my brother was in Gaza. I told my parents and my siblings, and thats how we found out. But no one came to see us at our home.
Two weeks after I contacted [an Israeli MP], the commander of the Gaza division came to see us for the first time, he told the paper. He told me they knew my brother was in Gaza, and that they have people who are keeping track of him and will bring him back  but that we should not tell people.
Yalo Mengistu claimed that if a white person had entered Gaza, the response would have been different. Its more than racism  I call it anti-blackism, he said. I am one million percent certain that if he were white, we would not have come to a situation like this.
Yaakov Peri, an Israeli MP and former head of the Israel security service who has been briefed on the situation, said every effort was being made to bring Mengistu and the bodies of the Israeli soldiers back.
He added that there were several cases of people crossing the fence each year.

Gaza war one year on: the Palestinian journalists living the news
Adding fresh details in a conference call with reporters, Peri said: [Mengistu] went missing between 7-8th September two weeks after the end of [operation] Protective Edge. The Israeli authorities identified his name and a couple of days later approached his family in Ashkelon and told them he crossed into Gaza and is being held by Hamas.
Hamas said in the beginning it didnt know anything about him. Several weeks later they said he was in Gaza but that they were not holding him. A couple of weeks after that they said he had left for Egypt. We know that is not true and that he is still probably being held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and since then we have been trying to bring him back.
For its own reasons Hamas has been keeping clandestine what is happening with him. My assessment is that Hamas will try to connect him [to negotiations for the return of the bodies] of two Israeli soldiers who were killed in operation Protective Edge.
Israels president, Reuven Rivlin, called on Thursday for Mengistu to be released on humanitarian grounds.
This is a painful situation which I  have been following closely since it began. I am in contact with the Mengistu family and I know that all the relevant authorities have been working tirelessly, and monitoring the issue closely, from the moment [he] crossed over the fence.
This is a humanitarian issue, and we expect those holding him to behave accordingly and return him in good health. According to the information which has arisen, Mengistu is being held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip. We will continue to make every effort in order to bring an end to this incident, as soon as possible.
Netanyahu said: We are working to return the two Israelis who crossed the fence into Gaza. We hold Hamas responsible for their welfare. I have appointed a representative to coordinate all activity on the issue and to be in contact with the families.
Hamas officials have denied that Mengistu is in their custody but did not dismiss the possibility that he had been held after crossing the border.

UN would struggle to cope with refugees in Greece if banks fail
Greek islands have received 9,000 refugees in past week alone, says United Nations, and its ability to pay for humanitarian supplies is at risk

The UN refugee agency says it will struggle to provide basic supplies to a wave of refugees in the Greek islands if the countrys banking system fails in the coming days.
Greeces islands have in recent weeks overtaken Italy as the primary entry point for refugees to Europe , with nearly 80,000 arriving this year from Turkey  a rate six times the equivalent figure from 2014, according to the UN.
More than 9,000 have arrived in the past week alone, and a UN spokeswoman on the island of Lesbos, which has taken in around half of the arrivals, says the organisations ability to give them items as basic as bottles of water and sleeping mats is at risk.

Laura Padoan said: The precarious financial situation means that if we cant access cash readily, it could threaten our programmes because we pay our suppliers through Greek accounts. We do depend on having ready cash. A lot of programmes depend on cash purchases of Greek goods.
The Athens government has been overwhelmed by the unprecedented wave of refugees on its eastern islands, many of which lie just a few miles from the Turkish coast, allowing refugees largely from the wartorn countries of Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan to risk the short journey in rubber boats. As many as 19 are feared to have drowned in recent days.
Greek officials are struggling to process the refugees in a timely manner, meaning they are unable to quickly reach the mainland and further stretch resources on the islands. Some islanders have set up their own makeshift camps for migrants .
The governments own camps are vastly overcrowded  with around 5,000 refugees squeezed into squalid conditions at the Kara Tepe camp on Lesbos. In at least some camps, the government has been unable to pay local caterers to provide food to the refugees, forcing the army to step in to provide emergency food at one camp on the island of Samos on Tuesday.
In the Greek parliament this week the migration minister, Tasia Christodoulopoulou, admitted the situation could lead to imminent riots by people demanding food.
Refugees are already losing patience, Padoan said. There have been fights that have broken out in Kara Tepe. People are getting really frustrated. Theres a lot of tension.
As well as a bottleneck on the islands, there is also a buildup of stranded migrants at Greeces northern borders. In recent months, refugees trying to reach other European countries have been able to walk into Macedonia, and then through the Balkans. But in recent days, the Macedonian authorities have moved to block the passage of most refugees, leading to an increasing number of migrants in limbo in the northernmost towns of Greece .
With Hungary  the next EU country on the Balkans migrant trail  trying to make it harder for migrants to enter its borders , there are fears many will decide to stay put in Greece, further stretching the countrys resources.
Adnother reason refugees could be forced to remain in Greece is that reported restrictions by international money transfer companies are preventing refugees being wired the large sums of money most rely on to fund their onward journeys.

Vatican officials appear to have been flummoxed after Pope Francis was presented with a communist crucifix depicting Jesus nailed to a hammer and sickle by Bolivias president Evo Morales.
The gift from the leftwing leader caused an immediate stir among conservative Catholics who said the pontiff was being manipulated for ideological reasons.
The response of the pope was less clear. After being handed the wooden crucifix during a formal ceremony, he examined it for a few seconds before returning it to a Bolivian presidential aide.
His comments were largely drowned out by a flurry of camera clicks, prompting a flood of speculation. While some have claimed he expressed irritation, muttering the words eso no est bien (this is not right), Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said the pope was more likely to have uttered eso no saba bien (I didnt know that) in bemusement at the origins of the present.
The Bolivian government insisted there was no political motive behind the gift. Communications minister Marianela Paco said Morales had thought the pope of the poor would appreciate the gesture.
That was the intention of this gift, and it was not any sort of maneuver ... It was really from great affection she told the Patria Nueva radio station.
But Rev James Bretzke, a theologian at Boston College in Massachusetts, accused Morales of attempting to manipulate the pope.
Does this seem to be using the crucifix for political agenda? And I would say the answer is probably yes. Therefore, I would judge it personally in bad taste and especially manipulative to present it to the Holy Father in a situation like that where it clearly hadnt been cleared ahead of time, he told the Associated Press.
Jos Ignacio Munilla, bishop of the Spanish city of San Sebastin tweeted a picture of the encounter, with the words: The height of pride is to manipulate God in the service of atheist ideologies.

El culmen de la soberbia es manipular a Dios al servicio de ideologas ateas... Hoy, una vez ms: #CristoCrucificado pic.twitter.com/uLbPPQDAGj
But it seems unlikely that the Pope would not have been completely unaware of the gifts meaning. The crucifix was modelled on one owned by Lus Espinal, a Jesuit priest, journalist and leftwing activist who was murdered by paramilitaries in 1980, when Bolivia was under a dictatorship.
On Wednesday night, Francis halted his popemobile from the airport to pray at the site where Espinals body was found.
Dear sisters and brothers. I stopped here to greet you and above all to remember. To remember a brother, our brother, a victim of interests who did not want him to fight for the freedom of Bolivia, the pope said on the scheduled stop.
He also reportedly received a medal, bearing a hammer and sickle, from Morales that was issued in memory of Espinals death.
Lombardi said he personally wasnt offended by Morales gift. You can dispute the significance and use of the symbol now, but the origin is from Espinal and the sense of it was about an open dialogue, not about a specific ideology, Lombardi said.

The Argentinian pope has been criticised in some quarters for not doing more to protect leftwing priests during the military dictatorship in his homeland. But since becoming pope in 2013, he has taken steps to reconcile the Vatican with progressive adherents of Liberation Theology , who argue that the Church should agitate for social and political change.
In Bolivia, Morales  a former coca farmer from an indigenous community  previously upset many in the local clergy by declaring the country secular in a new constitution. However, he has embraced the pope and praised him for supporting poor and marginalised groups.
Francis has used this trip to Latin America emphasize the problems faced by indigenous communities and to warn against all totalitarian, ideological or sectarian schemes.

The United Nations has announced that a humanitarian truce will go into force in Yemen to allow urgently needed aid to reach civilians facing the threat of famine in the war-torn country.
The pause in fighting will go into effect at 23.59 local time (2059 GMT) on Friday and last until the end of Ramadan on 17 July.
The announcement came eight days after the UN declared Yemen a level-3 humanitarian emergency, the highest on its scale, with nearly half of the countrys regions facing a food crisis.
It is imperative and urgent that humanitarian aid can reach all vulnerable people of Yemen unimpeded and through an unconditional humanitarian pause, UN spokesman Stphane Dujarric said on Thursday.

The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon , has received assurances from the Shia Houthi rebels and other parties that the pause will be fully respected and that there will be no violations from any combatants under their control, he added.
More than 21.1 million people  over 80% of Yemens population  are in need of aid, with 13 million facing food shortages. Access to water has become difficult for 9.4 million people, according to the UN.
Ban had repeatedly called for a humanitarian ceasefire to allow much-needed aid to be delivered to civilians suffering due to the air war and rebel offensives.
Yemen slid deeper into turmoil when a Saudi-led coalition launched air strikes in late March to stop an advance by the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels who drove the president into exile.
Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies are demanding that the Houthis pull back from territory seized in their offensive and that the president, Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, be restored to power.

The Los Angeles police department has told ABC News that it has opened an investigation into allegations of sexual abuse by Bill Cosby  including into those for which the statute of limitations has expired.
A Los Angeles police department spokesperson told the Guardian on Thursday that it would explore any sexual assault accusations against Cosby, including those for which the statute of limitations has expired.
The LAPD will always investigate all reports of crimes regardless of the statute of limitations for when the incident occurred. Asked if that applied to the accusations against Cosby, the spokesperson replied: Certainly.
The news comes after documents from a 2005 trial were released by the Associated Press in which the former comedian admitted giving a woman the sedative quaalude before having sex with her.

The 2005 lawsuit concerned separate allegations of abuse against Andrea Constand, a basketball coach at Temple University in Philadelphia. That case was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum, and the documents, which include testimony under oath from Cosby, remained under seal for almost a decade before being revealed on Monday. Constand consented to be identified but did not want to comment, her lawyer told the Associated Press on Monday.
In one of the documents, Cosby answers the question of whether he gave sedatives to one woman before having sex with her: Yes. He also admits to giving quaaludes to others.
In the nine years since the Constand lawsuit was settled, more than two dozen women have come forward with allegations of sexual abuse against Cosby. Almost all of the allegations involve variations of the same alleged modus operandi, with the victim being given either a pill or a drink before losing consciousness and allegedly being sexually assaulted.

On Wednesday, lawyers for Constand filed a motion with the court to make public the full transcript of the 2005 court proceedings, much of which is still unavailable to the public due to the terms of the original settlement.
At the same time, several civil suits against Cosby are pending in response to bullish statements made by his representatives about his accusers. In California, the supermodel Janice Dickinson  one of the many women who claim Cosby sexually abused them  is suing him for defamation; in Massachusetts , three more of his alleged victims, Tamara Green, Linda Traitz, and Therese Serignese, are also suing on the same grounds.
Lawyers for Cosby did not respond to repeated requests for comment, but Dickinsons lawyer Lisa Bloom described Mondays revelations as a game-changer.
Our case hinges on whether Janice Dickinson was telling the truth when she publicly accused Bill Cosby of drugging and raping her, Bloom told the Guardian. He has now admitted the substantial part of that claim, which is that he obtained drugs for use on young women.
That was the answer he gave; he cant wriggle out from under it now.

In large part, Cosbys accusers are focusing on defamation because the statutes of limitations for criminal charges on all of the allegations against Cosby so far have all run out. While crimes such as murder, arson or kidnapping can be prosecuted at any point, victims of sexual assault in the US have a limited time to file criminal charges, which range variously state-to-state from between three and 30 years.
None of the crimes that Cosby has so far been accused of fall within those time-frames.
However, ABC News reported on Wednesday that the Los Angeles police department was nonetheless investigating Cosby on a criminal basis. A spokesperson for the LAPD told the Guardian that if people bring forward allegations they are investigated no matter when the alleged crimes took place.
But the legal situation of the defamation suits against Cosby is much more complex. Both the California suit and the Massachusetts lawsuits are waiting for a judge to rule on motions by Cosbys lawyers to dismiss them, and victory for the plaintiffs  despite Mondays revelations  is by no means assured.
For the three who are suing in Massachusetts, a different statute of limitations may be in play. The alleged defamation in question took place in the press in 2014, but Cosbys lawyers are arguing that the actual statements were made much longer ago, in 2007, and simply repeated in the media in 2014. This would put them far outside the statute of limitations for defamation.
This is not the case for Dickinsons lawsuit in California, where the allegedly defamatory statement at issue happened well within the statute.
But both cases face other strict legal obstacles  aimed to protect freedom of speech  which could see both cases thrown out before they see a jury, no matter how guilty Cosby looks to the general public.
Additionally, because the 2005 deposition in which Cosby admits to giving a woman quaaludes and then having sex with her was only released on Monday, it isnt currently part of either the California or the Massachusetts court filings. That means that unless the legal teams rush through an updated complaint, it wont currently have any bearing on the judges ruling in either case.
If in either case the judge rules that the complaint has merit and they progress to a jury trial, then thats a whole new ball game, according to Michael Niborski, a veteran litigation attorney expert in defamation law  because thats when the plaintiffs can turn a defamation trial into a proxy rape trial.
But Niborski warned that due to several technicalities, the legal bars for either Dickinson in California or the plaintiffs in Massachusetts to get their days in court are still higher than they seem. If I had to bet my own money, I would bet that the judge would side with Cosbys lawyers, he said.
This is not because of a lack of evidence against Cosby  the evidence now includes his own admission under oath  but because the standards for a defamation suit are very different from those in a criminal case.
The statute of limitations on his alleged criminal acts  drugging, sexual assault and sexual battery  means Cosbys victims are suing him for what he said, rather than what he did to them. So, ironically for a case in which the crucial documents have been sealed by court order for almost a decade, the issue will become one of freedom of speech protected by the first amendment.
Nonetheless, Bloom, who is representing Dickinson in California, told the Guardian: I expect we will prevail. Her confidence was echoed by Joe Cammarata, the lawyer representing the three plaintiffs in Massachusetts, who told the Guardian on Tuesday that the new documents would go a long way toward crediting his clients allegations.
The wheels of just move very slowly, Bloom said, but they do eventually move.

In Yarmouk, hope is the only currency with value
With water, food and electricity in short supply, Syrians and Palestinians in the besieged refugee camp must find beauty in simple things, says a young writer

Abdullah al-Khateeb pondered the sniper bullet that had pierced the window of his home close to the besieged Yarmouk refugee camp. Astonishingly, he was grateful. The sniper had wanted to kill someone, but that hole has allowed a thread of sunlight to pierce through, he said. Everything has two sides. There is nothing that lacks beauty.
For several months, Khateeb has been writing an account of life amid deprivation and starvation to mirror the Forty Rules of Love by the 13th century Persian poet and mystic Rumi. In his 35th entry, he wrote: Under siege, beauty is an exceptional thing. Search for it, and if you happen to find it do not let it go, and if you do not find it, then try yourself to be beautiful.
Yarmouk, Khateebs home, a once-bustling neighbourhood in southern Damascus and a symbol of Bashar al-Assads regimes supposed dedication to the Palestinian cause, is in ruins after being starved of food, water and electricity by the government in a brutal three-year siege. Now, the terror group Islamic State stalks what is left of the camp, a short drive from the heart of Syrias capital.
Related: Isis closes in on Damascus after seizing Yarmouk refugee camp
Khateeb, 25, was a final-year student of sociology at Damascus University when the revolution began and has since dedicated his time to documenting it, as well as doing humanitarian work and training activists, many of whom have been killed, detained or forced to leave their homes. He moved to the outskirts of Yarmouk, to a village called Yalda, having fled Isis, which had attempted to kidnap him. He is also wanted by the Assad regime.
During a Skype interview from his home, Khateeb disconnects every half an hour. He has five laptops that he charges every night on a generator because electricity is cut off. The laptops belonged to activist friends who were killed, one on the first day Isis arrived as he tried to document the invasion with his camera.
When you lose a lot in siege and war, your heart hardens; it becomes like stone, Khateeb said. With the first loss, you weep for three days. The second, for two days. The third, for one day. The 10th martyr, you bury them and weep and then laugh, as a way to mock the whole situation. You develop a conviction that we are all going to die, but the issue is the order. So as long as we live, we will work.
When the uprising broke out in 2011, many youth in Yarmouk found a common cause. The neighbourhoods 1 million residents included 800,000 Syrians who, along with the Palestinians, suffered the brutality of the Assad dynastys police state.
While the Assad familys supporters have long touted their commitment to the Palestinian cause, his father had cracked down on the Palestinians during neighbouring Lebanons civil war, standing by as their refugee camps were besieged by Shia militias, and had arrested many activists in Syria itself.

Khateeb and his friends participated in demonstrations, but never organised anything inside the camp, which housed many refugees fleeing other parts of Syria, to keep it neutral. But, he said, the regime was determined to drag the Palestinians into the conflict, allowing local factions to distribute weapons at random for self-defence and demanding they act as local enforcers.
In response, rebels entered the camp, the Palestinian factions that were supposed to defend it withdrew and the regime responded with air strikes, many of which killed refugees. It slowly ramped up the siege, first limiting food, medical supplies and fuel, then finally imposing a total blockade that has lasted to this day.
Since then, Khateeb and his colleagues have documented about 170 deaths from hunger in Yarmouk, along with other deaths from wounds untreated because of the lack of medical facilities, staff and equipment. Close to two-thirds of Yarmouks children suffer from malnutrition.
The regime has used all weapons, from direct weapons like shelling, air strikes, rockets, chemical weapons, to starvation and torture, so nothing is surprising, he said. They havent left a single method you can think of to make a people bow. But instead of bowing, Khateeb carried on working, and he began writing about the siege.
Its these little details that let the observer know what being under siege means, he said. It is the worst social experience after imprisonment, because the siege is not just a method of physical attrition, it is more a form of spiritual attrition.
The Forty Rules of Siege, of which 36 have been published so far on his Facebook page , draw from Khateebs experiences.
One rule describes how the besieged must walk on wind because every tread may crush something that once provided nourishment. He hesitates before stepping on a plant in a nearby orchard that the animals usually eat, and which people in Yarmouk had to eat, because he may be faced with that hunger again. He remembers nights when all they had was boiling water flavored with spices because they could not have soup.

During the siege, the idea of having a cup of tea was extremely difficult, he said. When I and the others would sit around and drink tea, we would feel a strange pleasure.
This is one of the positive things about the siege, it makes you feel the value of things, the simple things like drinking a cup of tea or sitting together and eating bread, he added. These things you take for granted, you feel their value. [You realise] that happiness is a decision, not something you search for. It is the things that we have in front of us, that we do not realise until we lose.
Khateeb recalled how, in the early days of the siege when they still had some food, he and his friends would gather at a warehouse and grind lentils and bulgur to make bread. Then a purported regime shell struck, killing a friend who was sitting next to him. His blood spilling into the mixture.
They tried to take away every beautiful ritual we came up with, he said. I could no longer go to this place.
The brutality of the siege has left Khateeb with a desire for personal revenge against a regime whose violence has meant that he had to personally bury about 10 of his friends. It was that brutality, he said, that had led to the rise of extremism in Syria, where Isis now controls roughly half the countrys landmass and Jabhat al-Nusra, the al-Qaeda affiliate, reigns as one of the most powerful rebel groups.
Related: 'Yarmouk is being annihilated': Palestinians in Syria are left to their fate
Extremism is a result of extremism, he said. The revolution was peaceful, the regime acted with monstrosity, people carried weapons. The regime launched air strikes, more gunmen emerged. The regime used chemical weapons , people became Islamist. The regime killed women, people became Nusra. It became more extreme, people became Daesh (Isis).
That is the basis of the 34th rule of siege: that oppression breeds extremism. Khateeb said the only way he was able to shield himself was that he never lost hope  in the annals of history, he said, no people has ever been subjugated forever.
I cannot lose absolute hope, he added. The moment I lose hope I will either commit suicide or youll see me in the streets carrying the Daesh flag.
Optimism is hard to come by in Yarmouk, where Isis holds sway. But Khateeb said it was the little details that inspired hope  the fact that schools never fully closed in the camp, that social development programmes carried on, that residents still put on plays and held poetry nights.
A people that are still alive is a sign of victory, he said. So long as there are people painting, people playing piano, people getting an education, all of these are signs of optimism.
Khateeb was not surprised when Isis entered the camp in collusion with the local branch of Jabhat al-Nusra, many of whom had secretly pledged allegiance to Islamic State.
Still, he resents how the Syrian uprising is portrayed outside the country as a battle between the regime and Isis, which he described as a cancerous organisation.
When Daesh entered, 10 people were killed in the fighting but, before that, 170 people died of hunger, he said. Those who see the events in Syria with the lens of Isis and extremism are partners in the massacre against the Syrian people.
Yarmouk has been dying for three years, he added.

'Real-life' house from Up is something to believe in  until it gets torn down
This Seattle bungalow did not inspire the film, but has become a popular tourist spot  and a symbol of the gentrification battle that has gripped the city for two decades, as potential owners have repeatedly been denied permits

Nobody will buy Edith Macefields old house anymore.
Not then, when the 87-year-old woman refused a million-dollar offer from a shopping complex developer in 2007. Not now, after this gentrifying city told four potential buyers her home is no longer safe to inhabit.
The North Carolina bank that owns this tiny Seattle bungalow  with a national apparel outlet on one side, and an LA Fitness gym on the other  will donate it to the person who comes up with the best proposal by the end of the month for removal or restoration. Otherwise, this old house will be torn down.

Perhaps it would be gone by now had a local publicist not affixed balloons to its outside in 2009, a year after Macefields death, to promote the Pixar movie Up  a story remarkably similar to Macefields, about an elderly man who would not sell a house. The house looked remarkably similar to this one, with huge buildings rising on all sides. The man in the film eventually sailed his life away with the help of more than 10,000 balloons.
Soon the old house became the Up house  a real-life reminder of a Hollywood blockbuster, one that draws people from all over the world in the mistaken presumption that the house actually sponsored the movie. They tie balloons on a chain-link fence that keeps people from trespassing on the sliver of property cut from the shopping center.
They write messages on the balloons: We will remember the little guy, one passer-by wrote in permanent marker.
They write about Up: Good movie. Good people.
They write about fading blue-collar lives  this house has become an international symbol of a losing fight everywhere to preserve local properties against the encroaching big chain gym and apparel stores next door:
Seattles last stand, write the old-timers.
Up wasnt based on Edith Macefields house or her life.

And so in the final days of the Up house, people have come to find meanings in it that are not real. Because Edith Macefield wasnt fighting anyone; she just wanted to die in the house she owned for half a century. Up wasnt based on her house or her life  Pixars film had been in production long before she turned down the million. Nor does the gentrification battle that has gripped Seattle for two decades have anything to do with this house here on Northwest 46th Street, in the heavy-industrial part of town.
It was somebodys home and eventually everybody wanted it to be something else, said Barry Martin, the construction supervisor on the shopping complex, to whom Macefield willed her home. Everybody has got to have something to believe in, and if that helps people get through their life or get through hard times, thats OK. Because what they are going for is true. What they are going for is in their head.

They come to the Up house in ways Paul Thomas still cannot fully understand. He is the Seattle real-estate broker hired by the bank, American IRA LLC, to handle the transfer of the house and an eventual sale of the remaining 1,550-square-foot lot.
Thomas also has become the unofficial caretaker of this little old house, putting on windows and a door after a recent attempted renovation left it without either. He has tried to explain to the passers-by, again and again, that it is not, in fact, the inspiration for Up. But people still believe, mostly because they want to.
Its like a pilgrimage, he told the Guardian. People go to a place and put whatever memories they need to on it. Everybody who goes there seems to have so many radically different reasons for going.
Tatiana Reger, from San Francisco, wanted a picture because her mother refuses to leave her house, too.
Julie Haefner, who lives in Connecticut, wanted a photo of her parents in front of the Up house because she and her sister both had pictures of their own families; she wanted the complete set.
Sherry Bosch, visiting from Phoenix, came in the spirit of her nieces Up-themed wedding; they had even asked guests to sign an adventure book, just like the one Ellie, the wife in Up, had for all her dreams.
Thanks to you, Megan and Rob are sharing adventures, Sherry wrote on a blue balloon.

When the publicists hired by Pixar asked Martin if they could tie balloons to the roof of the house, he said yes. As a promotion, the idea was genius: the parallel between the fictional Carl Fredrickson and Macefield seemed uncanny.
But Macefields stubbornness stood for a city rapidly losing its blue-collar roots, where the median price of a home jumped 18.9% in the last year, and the earners in the top fifth of the population make 18 times more than the bottom fifth. As rows of gleaming new office towers and luxury condominiums kept going up downtown, Seattle became two cities, with this little house in the middle.
Greg Pinneo, who bought the house from Martin after the will process, left his investment midway through when costs got too high. Four other potential buyers gave up after the city demanded costly earthquake retrofits.
Then one day Thomas, the new real-estate broker, was installing windows on the house when he heard a noise outside. A family from Idaho were at the end of their vacation and had time for one last attraction: the Space Needle or the Up house. The kids voted for the house. As a tribute, they tied balloons to the fence.
The next day, Thomas bought a big package of balloons and put several in a cup, tethered to the chain link fence that has been in front of the house since Macefields death, along with some Sharpie pens. People used them all up; he had to buy more when supplies ran low.
Macefield never enjoyed the attention she got for turning down that million for her house, Martin says, because she had just one wish: She was doing nothing more than trying to live out her life, in her home, he said.
In a city that loves to celebrate obscure anti-establishment heroes, here was someone who could not be bought  who had no desire for the money, and no children to whom she could bequeath it. She would rather someone build a shopping center on all sides of her home than move. Soon, a local tattoo parlor was engraving her name on peoples arms, and a group of locals started an Edith Macefield music festival.
Soon after Macefield died in 2008, the house was gutted. The walls, floorboards and support beams were pulled out and replaced with modern plywood. Only the old roof remains. When Pinneo ran out of funds, the bank and Thomas tried to find buyers with imaginative ideas for the house.
The most intriguing was a mother-daughter pie shop that would have had stained-glass windows with etchings of balloons. But city officials kept denying the mother-daughter team permits. Three other potential buyers abandoned attempts to buy the property after similar permitting issues.
One thing I find incredibly aggravating is that several entrepreneurs encountered resistance from the city, and yet all over the city there are developers who raze single-family homes and build big towering apartments, Thomas said.

One morning this week, Rick Sullivan drove about 20 blocks from his apartment to buy socks at Ross.
He tried to park across the street, but a car cut him off so he made a U-turn in front a fence, and suddenly he was staring at Edith Macefields old house behind it, telling a stranger a story about his wife Michele, who had a stroke one day last fall. Nine days later, she was dead at just 39. They lived in Minnesota, where he was a physical therapist and she was a communications executive at Land OLakes. They had lived in Malaysia for a few years and there were more adventures they wanted to have together. The last couple years she had been planning an around-the-world trip they would take.
When Rick Sullivans wife died, he couldnt bear living in Minnesota anymore, so he moved here to the Ballard part of town, where the fight to preserve an older Seattle against the onslaught of apartment and condo complexes has raged hard. That morning he had been to the Verizon store and discovered that the pictures he thought he had lost of Michele were on his phone after all. Now he was talking about the around-the-world trip they would not take.
Had he seen Up? Did he know about Ellies adventure book in the movie, about her South American dream that sounded quite a lot like his wifes idea for a big trip? Did he know how in the film, Carl had bought that vacation for his wife and on the day he was going to give her the ticket she could barely walk up a hill? And how, in the next scene, Ellie was in the hospital and the scene after that was in the funeral home? Did he know about the adventure not yet taken?
No, Rick Sullivan said, he had never seen Up. He stared at his phone, at the newly recovered pictures of his dead wife. For a moment, he was silent. Then he looked up.
I think I have to go watch that movie, he said. Thank you.
Then he left, first to buy socks for the empty closet in his lonely apartment, then to go find a movie he had never heard of, that people believed was inspired by a house just an accidental U-turn away.
But none of it, he thought, was an accident.
I know I was meant to come here today, he said.

China stocks bounce back after days of panic selling among investors
Market crisis eases, though it remains unclear whether apparent recovery is a temporary reprieve or beginning of stabilisation

Chinas stock markets have bounced back, restoring some calm to markets after days of panic selling.
The deepening crisis prompted Chinas stock exchange regulator to impose severe limits on share selling on Wednesday, warning of a panic in the market  Beijings most drastic step yet. Shareholders with large stakes in listed firms were banned from selling for six months, in an attempt to halt the wild swings seen in stock markets in recent days.
The CSI 300 index of the biggest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen gained 6.4% on Thursday, but investors remained nervous. The Shanghai Composite rose 5.8%, the biggest daily percentage gain in six years. Hong Kongs stock market also rebounded, finishing 3.7% higher. On Wednesday, the Hang Seng dropped 5.8%, its biggest one-day percentage fall since the financial crisis in 2008, as panic spread from China .
It remains to be seen whether this is a temporary reprieve or the start of a stabilisation.
The bounceback in China boosted global oil prices, with Brent crude up 66 cents at $57.72 (37.52) a barrel, a 1.2% rise; and New York crude rising 90 cents to $52.55 a barrel, a 1.7% gain.

Police and regulators are investigating evidence of potential malicious short selling of Chinese shares, state news agency Xinhua reported. The vice-minister of public security, Meng Qingfeng and a team of officials visited the office of the security regulator on Thursday morning, a sign the authorities will severely punish operations that violate laws and regulations.
Chinas banking regulator said it would allow banks to extend mortgages that have used shares as collateral. The central bank also announced it was injecting 35bn yuan into the markets. It is the fifth cash injection the Peoples Bank of China has carried out since 25 June.
Some analysts believe the governments measures are starting to have an impact. It looks like the government plan is quite successful, that the market is again back to having ample liquidity, said Jiahe Chen, chief strategist at Cinda Securities.
But others said it was too early to tell whether the stock market rout is over, noting that about half of all China-listed firms have stopped trading.
Chinas mainland stocks have lost more than a quarter of their value since reaching a peak on 12 June, in the biggest slide since the global financial crisis in 2008. Some $4tn has been wiped off the stock market value of companies, forcing Chinese regulators to take unprecedented measures to stabilise markets.

Economists at Credit Suisse said: We are inclined to believe that Beijing will escalate policy responses until they start working. If market conditions do not stabilise, we expect a statement of whatever it takes from the Chinese government, given that social stability is at stake and financial systemic risks are evident.
Chinas government, central bank and regulators have been pulling out all the stops to prop up share prices  including a freeze on new stock market listings and cutting interest rates to new record lows. The countrys top brokerages vowed to buy billions of dollars worth of shares last weekend. But the measures appeared to have little effect in the first three days of this week, with the sell-off continuing.
The US administration has expressed concerns the stock market crash could delay Beijings economic reforms . There are mounting warnings the Chinese stock market rout poses a bigger risk to the global financial system than the Greek debt crisis.
Nigel Green, the founder and chief executive of financial consultancy deVere Group, said: With the Chinese stock market losing a third of its value since mid-June, which is about equivalent to the UKs entire economic output last year, this has all the makings of morphing into a major financial crisis.
Despite few foreign investors having much exposure to the Chinese stock markets, the meltdown matters. Indeed, it is hugely significant because it will send shockwaves throughout global capital markets, not least because China is the worlds second-largest economy and one of the largest consumers of commodities and other goods sold by other countries. As such, China, not Greece, is arguably the main cause for concern for investors right now.
Australian financial services firm AMP lambasted Chinese regulators for contributing to the panic sell-off  the first time a foreign investor has publicly criticised Beijings intervention in its markets. The firms AMP Capital China Growth Fund, the biggest Australian fund that invests exclusively in China shares, has seen its market value shrink by A$272m to A$440m.
However, Chen believes it is important the government is taking some action. The worst thing for a financial market is not the fluctuation of price, but overall lacking of confidence and liquidity. It needs government action to reverse this kind of situation as it is not a normal situation that can be corrected by the market itself, he said.
In China, some 80% of investors are individuals, many of whom have borrowed from a broker to play the stock market.
The past six months have seen a record number of businesses listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, and an explosion in margin trading. This means a broker can ask for more cash or other collateral if the price of securities falls, which is known as a margin call. As regulators have cracked down on margin trading, falling share prices have triggered margin calls  forcing investors to offload assets to come up with the cash.
HSBC cut its growth outlook for this year for Asia excluding Japan to 6.3% from 6.5%. Things arent exactly going according to plan, the bank said on Wednesday. Asias export malaise is not just a temporary blip, but reflects longer-lasting structural factors, with a trade rebound unlikely.

'A new day in South Carolina' as house votes to remove Confederate flag
House of representatives vote means the banner could come down from statehouse grounds within days following a marathon debate by lawmakers
Republican representative, Jenny Anderson Horne, implores fellow party members to vote to remove the Confederate flag on Thursday.

The South Carolina house of representatives has approved taking down the Confederate flag from the state capitols grounds.
Republican governor Nikki Haley said it was a new day in South Carolina, a day we can all be proud of after the bill was approved.
She said the measure truly brings us all together as we continue to heal, as one people and one state.
The house approved the bill 93-27, and it must be ratified before being sent to Haley, who supports it. It has already been passed by the state senate.
The flag must then be removed within 24 hours of her signing the bill  which could happen as early as Thursday.

It represents a stunning reversal in a state that was the first to leave the union in 1860 and raised the flag again at its statehouse more than 50 years ago to protest against the civil rights movement.
The move came just after 1am on Thursday, after more than 13 hours of at times contentious debate. It follows the fatal shootings of nine black church members , including a state senator, at a Bible study in Charleston. The alleged gunman, 21-year-old Dylann Roof, is believed to have supported white supremacy and posed in many photos next to the flag .

The campaign to remove the flag from South Carolinas capitol grounds had been dragging on into the night , with the House of Representatives refusing to adjourn after 12 hours of debate.
The chamber voted 111-3 to keep going as the clock moved toward midnight during a marathon session on Wednesday to decide the future of a banner that symbolizes slavery and racism for many, but southern heritage for others.
Tempers began to fray as Republicans proposed 68 amendments in an attempt to soften the impact of legislation to move the flag to a museum.
At each turn, they were beaten back by a slightly larger, bipartisan group of legislators who believed there must be no delay.
South Carolina legislators were stuck debating issues such as whether flowers should be planted where the flagpole bearing a Confederate flag stands at the state house in Columbia.
The closest vote in the GOP-controlled body came on an amendment to place the state flag beside the monument to Confederate soldiers at the front of the statehouse.

Changing the senate bill could have meant weeks or even months of delay, perhaps blunting momentum that has grown since the church massacre.
Republican Jenny Horne reminded her colleagues she was a descendant of Confederate president Jefferson Davis, and scolded fellow members of her party for stalling the debate.
She cried as she remembered the funeral of her colleague, state senator Clementa Pinckney, the pastor of Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church, who was gunned down as his wife and daughter locked themselves in an office.
For the widow of Senator Pinckney and his two young daughters, that would be adding insult to injury and I will not be a part of it, she shouted.
She said later during a break she had not intended to speak but got frustrated with fellow Republicans.
Opponents of removing the flag talked about grandparents who passed down family treasures and lamented that the flag had been hijacked or abducted by racists.
Mike Pitts, who remembered playing with a Confederate ancestors cavalry sword while growing up, said for him the flag was a reminder of how dirt-poor southern farmers fought Yankees, not because they hated blacks or supported slavery, but because their land was being invaded.

Those soldiers should be respected just as soldiers who fought in the Middle East or Afghanistan, he said, recalling his own military service. Pitts then turned to a lawmaker he called a dear friend, recalling how his black colleague nearly died in Vietnam.
Im willing to move that flag at some point if it causes a twinge in the hearts of my friends, Pitts said. But Ill ask for something in return.
The flag was moved from the top of the statehouse dome to a 30-foot pole on the building grounds in 2000 after nearly four decades of protests against it. After the shooting in Charleston, the push to take down the flag intensified, with hundreds demonstrating at the state house three days later.
Since then, the Capitol grounds have been the site of ongoing protests as people demonstrated against the flag or defended it. Last month , activist Bree Newsome was arrested after climbing the flagpole and pulling down the flag.
State senator Vincent Sheheen, who introduced the bill, had called for the flag to be removed last year. Im looking forward to more steps toward unity and healing in South Carolina, he said.
And most importantly, my thoughts and prayers still remain with our friend Clem, his family and the eight other victims and families, Sheheen said. I wish he were here with us to celebrate but I know hes looking down on us extremely proud of what has been accomplished.

The disgraced former Fifa executive Chuck Blazer has been handed a life ban from all football-related activity by Fifas ethics committee for bribery and other corruption.
In a statement, Fifas ethics panel said Blazer had committed many and various acts of misconduct continuously and repeatedly during his time as an official in different high-ranking and influential positions at Fifa and Concacaf.
In his positions as a football official, he was a key player in schemes involving the offer, acceptance, payment and receipt of undisclosed and illegal payments, bribes and kickbacks as well as other money-making schemes.
Blazer, 70, pleaded guilty to 10 charges, including bribery, money laundering and tax evasion, in 2013. The charges carried a maximum concurrent imprisonment term of 75 years, but Blazer agreed to become an informant for the FBI and US justice department in return for immunity from prosecution.
The plea bargain, which was made public last month , revealed that Blazer, who was general secretary of the Concacaf governing body, began providing information to the authorities in December 2011  more than three years before the US government charged 14 current and former Fifa officials with hijacking international football to run a World Cup of fraud.
Blazer, who was a Fifa executive committee member from 1997 to 2013, secretly pleaded guilty in November 2013, agreeing to provide truthful, complete and accurate information to prosecutors and to participate in undercover activities pursuant to the specific instructions of law enforcement agents.
Fifa said Blazers life ban is effective from 9 July 2015, the date on which the present decision was notified.

Exxon knew of climate change in 1981, email says  but it funded deniers for 27 more years
A newly unearthed missive from Lenny Bernstein, a climate expert with the oil firm for 30 years, shows concerns over high presence of carbon dioxide in enormous gas field in south-east Asia factored into decision not to tap it

ExxonMobil, the worlds biggest oil company, knew as early as 1981 of climate change  seven years before it became a public issue, according to a newly discovered email from one of the firms own scientists. Despite this the firm spent millions over the next 27 years to promote climate denial.
The email from Exxons in-house climate expert provides evidence the company was aware of the connection between fossil fuels and climate change, and the potential for carbon-cutting regulations that could hurt its bottom line, over a generation ago  factoring that knowledge into its decision about an enormous gas field in south-east Asia. The field, off the coast of Indonesia, would have been the single largest source of global warming pollution at the time.
Exxon first got interested in climate change in 1981 because it was seeking to develop the Natuna gas field off Indonesia, Lenny Bernstein, a 30-year industry veteran and Exxons former in-house climate expert, wrote in the email. This is an immense reserve of natural gas, but it is 70% CO2, or carbon dioxide, the main driver of climate change.
Related: Rockefeller family tried and failed to get ExxonMobil to accept climate change
However, Exxons public position was marked by continued refusal to acknowledge the dangers of climate change, even in response to appeals from the Rockefellers , its founding family, and its continued financial support for climate denial. Over the years, Exxon spent more than $30m on thinktanks and researchers that promoted climate denial, according to Greenpeace.
Exxon said on Wednesday that it now acknowledges the risk of climate change and does not fund climate change denial groups.
Some climate campaigners have likened the industry to the conduct of the tobacco industry which for decades resisted the evidence that smoking causes cancer.
In the email Bernstein, a chemical engineer and climate expert who spent 30 years at Exxon and Mobil and was a lead author on two of the United Nations blockbuster IPCC climate science reports, said climate change first emerged on the companys radar in 1981, when the company was considering the development of south-east Asias biggest gas field, off Indonesia.
That was seven years ahead of other oil companies and the public, according to Bernsteins account.
Climate change was largely confined to the realm of science until 1988, when the climate scientist James Hansen told Congress that global warming was caused by the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, due to the burning of fossil fuels.
By that time, it was clear that developing the Natuna site would set off a huge amount of climate change pollution  effectively a carbon bomb, according to Bernstein.
When I first learned about the project in 1989, the projections were that if Natuna were developed and its CO2 vented to the atmosphere, it would be the largest point source of CO2 in the world and account for about 1% of projected global CO2 emissions. Im sure that it would still be the largest point source of CO2, but since CO2 emissions have grown faster than projected in 1989, it would probably account for a smaller fraction of global CO2 emissions, Bernstein wrote.
The email was written in response to an inquiry on business ethics from the Institute for Applied and Professional Ethics at Ohio University.
What it shows is that Exxon knew years earlier than James Hansens testimony to Congress that climate change was a reality; that it accepted the reality, instead of denying the reality as they have done publicly, and to such an extent that it took it into account in their decision making, in making their economic calculation, the director of the institute, Alyssa Bernstein (no relation), told the Guardian.
One thing that occurs to me is the behavior of the tobacco companies denying the connection between smoking and lung cancer for the sake of profits, but this is an order of magnitude greater moral offence, in my opinion, because what is at stake is the fate of the planet, humanity, and the future of civilisation, not to be melodramatic.
Bernsteins response, first posted on the institutes website last October, was released by the Union of Concerned Scientists on Wednesday as part of a report on climate disinformation promoted by companies such as ExxonMobil, BP, Shell and Peabody Energy, called the Climate Deception Dossiers .
Asked about Bernsteins comments, Exxon said climate science in the early 1980s was at a preliminary stage, but the company now saw climate change as a risk.
The science in 1981 on this subject was in the very, very early days and there was considerable division of opinion
Richard Keil, Exxon spokesman
The science in 1981 on this subject was in the very, very early days and there was considerable division of opinion, Richard Keil, an Exxon spokesman, said. There was nobody you could have gone to in 1981 or 1984 who would have said whether it was real or not. Nobody could provide a definitive answer.
He rejected the idea that Exxon had funded groups promoting climate denial. I am here to talk to you about the present, he said. We have been factoring the likelihood of some kind of carbon tax into our business planning since 2007. We do not fund or support those who deny the reality of climate change.
Exxon, unlike other companies and the public at large in the early 1980s, was already aware of climate change  and the prospect of regulations to limit the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change, according to Bernsteins account.
In the 1980s, Exxon needed to understand the potential for concerns about climate change to lead to regulation that would affect Natuna and other potential projects. They were well ahead of the rest of industry in this awareness. Other companies, such as Mobil, only became aware of the issue in 1988, when it first became a political issue, he wrote.
Natural resource companies  oil, coal, minerals  have to make investments that have lifetimes of 50-100 years. Whatever their public stance, internally they make very careful assessments of the potential for regulation, including the scientific basis for those regulations, Bernstein wrote in the email.
Naomi Oreskes, a Harvard University professor who researches the history of climate science, said it was unsurprising Exxon would have factored climate change in its plans in the early 1980s  but she disputed Bernsteins suggestion that other companies were not. She also took issue with Exxons assertion of uncertainty about the science in the 1980s, noting the National Academy of Science describing a consensus on climate change from the 1970s.
The White House and the National Academy of Sciences came out with reports on climate change in the 1970s, and government scientific agencies were studying climate change in the 1960s, she said. There were also a number of major scientific meetings on climate change in the 1970s.
I find it difficult to believe that an industry whose business model depends on fossil fuels could have been completely ignoring major environmental reports, major environmental meetings taken place in which carbon dioxide and climate change were talked about, she said in an interview with the Guardian.
The East Natuna gas field, about 140 miles north-east of the Natuna islands in the South China Sea and 700 miles north of Jakarta, is the biggest in south-east Asia, with about 46tn cubic ft (1.3tn cubic metres) of recoverable reserves.
However, Exxon did not go into production on the field.
Corporations are interested in environmental impacts only to the extent that they affect profits
Lenny Bernstein
Bernstein writes in his email to Ohio University: Corporations are interested in environmental impacts only to the extent that they affect profits, either current or future. They may take what appears to be altruistic positions to improve their public image, but the assumption underlying those actions is that they will increase future profits. ExxonMobil is an interesting case in point.
Bernstein, who is now in his mid-70s, spent 20 years as a scientist at Exxon and 10 years at Mobil. During the 1990s he headed the science and technology advisory committee of the Global Climate Coalition, an industry group that lobbied aggressively against the scientific consensus around the causes of climate change.
However, GCC climate experts accepted the impact of human activity on climate change in their internal communications as early as 1995, according to a document filed in a 2009 lawsuit and included in the UCS dossier.

The document, a 17-page primer on climate science produced by Bernsteins advisory committee, discounts the alternate theories about the causes of climate change promoted by climate contrarian researchers such as Willie Soon, who was partly funded by Exxon .
The contrarian theories raise interesting questions about our total understanding of climate processes, but they do not offer convincing arguments against the conventional model of greenhouse gas emission-induced climate change, the advisory committee said.
The 1995 primer was never released for publication. A subsequent version, which was publicly distributed in 1998, removed the reference to contrarian theories, and continued to dispute the science underlying climate change.
Kenneth Kimmel, the president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said ExxonMobil and the other companies profiled in its report had failed to take responsibility about the danger to the public of producing fossil fuels.
Related: US taxpayers subsidising world's biggest fossil fuel companies
Instead of taking responsibility, they have either directly  or indirectly through trade and industry groups  sown doubt about the science of climate change and fought efforts to cut emissions, he wrote in a blogpost. I believe that the conduct outlined in the UCS report puts the fossil fuel companies social license at risk. And once that social license is gone, it is very hard to get it back. Just look at what happened to tobacco companies after litigation finally pried open the documents that exposed decades of misinformation and deception.
Keil, the ExxonMobil spokesman, confirmed that the company had decided not to develop Natuna, but would not comment on the reasons. There could be a huge range of reasons why we dont develop projects, he said.

Below is the text of an email from Lenny Bernstein to the director of the Institute for Applied and Professional Ethics at Ohio University, Alyssa Bernstein (no relation), who had asked for ideas to stimulate students for an ethics day announced by the Carnegie Council.
Alyssas right. Feel free to share this e-mail with her. Corporations are interested in environmental impacts only to the extent that they affect profits, either current or future. They may take what appears to be altruistic positions to improve their public image, but the assumption underlying those actions is that they will increase future profits. ExxonMobil is an interesting case in point.
Exxon first got interested in climate change in 1981 because it was seeking to develop the Natuna gas field off Indonesia. This is an immense reserve of natural gas, but it is 70% CO2. That CO2 would have to be separated to make the natural gas usable. Natural gas often contains CO2 and the technology for removing CO2 is well known. In 1981 (and now) the usual practice was to vent the CO2 to the atmosphere. When I first learned about the project in 1989, the projections were that if Natuna were developed and its CO2 vented to the atmosphere, it would be the largest point source of CO2 in the world and account for about 1% of projected global CO2 emissions. Im sure that it would still be the largest point source of CO2, but since CO2 emissions have grown faster than projected in 1989, it would probably account for a smaller fraction of global CO2 emissions.
The alternative to venting CO2 to the atmosphere is to inject it into ground. This technology was also well known, since the oil industry had been injecting limited quantities of CO2 to enhance oil recovery. There were many questions about whether the CO2 would remain in the ground, some of which have been answered by Statoils now almost 20 years of experience injecting CO2 in the North Sea. Statoil did this because the Norwegian government placed a tax on vented CO2. It was cheaper for Statoil to inject CO2 than pay the tax. Of course, Statoil has touted how much CO2 it has prevented from being emitted.
In the 1980s, Exxon needed to understand the potential for concerns about climate change to lead to regulation that would affect Natuna and other potential projects. They were well ahead of the rest of industry in this awareness. Other companies, such as Mobil, only became aware of the issue in 1988, when it first became a political issue. Natural resource companies  oil, coal, minerals  have to make investments that have lifetimes of 50-100 years. Whatever their public stance, internally they make very careful assessments of the potential for regulation, including the scientific basis for those regulations. Exxon NEVER denied the potential for humans to impact the climate system. It did question  legitimately, in my opinion  the validity of some of the science.
Political battles need to personify the enemy. This is why liberals spend so much time vilifying the Koch brothers  who are hardly the only big money supporters of conservative ideas. In climate change, the first villain was a man named Donald Pearlman, who was a lobbyist for Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. (In another life, he was instrumental in getting the US Holocaust Museum funded and built.) Pearlmans usefulness as a villain ended when he died of lung cancer  he was a heavy smoker to the end.
Then the villain was the Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a trade organization of energy producers and large energy users. I was involved in GCC for a while, unsuccessfully trying to get them to recognize scientific reality. (That effort got me on to the front page of the New York Times, but thats another story.) Environmental group pressure was successful in putting GCC out of business, but they also lost their villain. They needed one which wouldnt die and wouldnt go out of business. Exxon, and after its merger with Mobil ExxonMobil, fit the bill, especially under its former CEO, Lee Raymond, who was vocally opposed to climate change regulation. ExxonMobils current CEO, Rex Tillerson, has taken a much softer line, but ExxonMobil has not lost its position as the personification of corporate, and especially climate change, evil. It is the only company mentioned in Alyssas e-mail, even though, in my opinion, it is far more ethical that many other large corporations.
Having spent twenty years working for Exxon and ten working for Mobil, I know that much of that ethical behavior comes from a business calculation that it is cheaper in the long run to be ethical than unethical. Safety is the clearest example of this. ExxonMobil knows all too well the cost of poor safety practices. The Exxon Valdez is the most public, but far from the only, example of the high cost of unsafe operations. The value of good environmental practices are more subtle, but a facility that does a good job of controlling emission and waste is a well run facility, that is probably maximizing profit. All major companies will tell you that they are trying to minimize their internal CO2 emissions. Mostly, they are doing this by improving energy efficiency and reducing cost. The same is true for internal recycling, again a practice most companies follow. Its [sic] just good engineering.
I could go on, but this e-mail is long enough.

Rights groups and the United Nations have condemned Thailands decision to fly nearly 100 Uighur Muslims back to China , warning that the Turkic language-speaking, largely Muslim minority would face persecution and abuse.
The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) said it had previously been given assurances by Thai authorities that the group would receive protection, and that the group had indicated they did not wish to be deported.
A spokesman for the Thai government said Bangkok and Beijing had worked together to solve the Uighur Muslim problem and that China said it would look after their safety.
Hundreds, possibly thousands of Uighurs have fled unrest in Chinas western Xinjiang region, where hundreds of people have been killed. Many have made for south-east Asia in the hope of reaching Turkey.
Many Uighurs regard the Chinese as a colonising power and refer privately to Xinjiang as East Turkistan. In Mandarin, xinjiang translates as new frontier. A tiny minority are fighting for an independent state. Their ties with Turkey are both religious and ethnic.
Chinas treatment of the Uighurs is an issue of concern in Turkey and the deportation may sour relations between Ankara and Beijing. About 20 million Muslims live in China and many Uighurs have already moved to Turkey.
Thailands embassy in Ankara posted on its Facebook page that pro-Uighur protesters had stormed the consulate on Wednesday. It warned about 1,300 Thais living in Turkey to be on alert following the attack.
It is very shocking and disturbing that Thailand caved in to pressure from Beijing, Sunai Phasuk, Thailand researcher at Human Rights Watch, told Reuters.

By forcibly sending back at least 90 Uighurs, Thailand has violated international law. In China they can face serious abuses including torture and disappearance.
The Thai government said 170 other Uighurs were identified as Turkish citizens and were sent to Turkey. Fifty more still needed to have their citizenship verified, it said.
The UNHCR urged authorities in the strongest possible terms to allow those remaining to depart voluntarily and as soon as possible to a country of their choice.
While we are seeking further clarifications on what happened exactly, we are shocked by this deportation of some 100 people and consider it a flagrant violation of international law, said Volker Trk , UNHCRs assistant high commissioner for protection, who is currently in the region.
He said: I strongly urge the Thai authorities to investigate this matter.

The US National Security Agency tapped phone calls involving German chancellor Angela Merkel and her closest advisers for years and spied on the staff of her predecessors, according to WikiLeaks.
A report released by the group on Wednesday suggested NSA spying on Merkel and her staff had gone on far longer and more widely than previously realised. WikiLeaks said the NSA targeted 125 phone numbers of top German officials for long-term surveillance .
The release risks renewing tensions between Germany and the US a month after they sought to put a row over spying behind them, with Barack Obama declaring in Bavaria that the two nations were inseparable allies.
WikiLeaks published what it said were three NSA intercepts of Merkels conversations, and data it said listed telephone numbers for the chancellor, her aides, her office and even her fax machine.
The names associated with some of the targets indicate that spying on the Chancellery predates Angela Merkel as it includes staff of former Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder (in office 1998-2002), and his predecessor Helmut Kohl, WikiLeaks added in a statement.
No comment was immediately available from the German government.
The intercepts released on Wednesday detailed communications from Merkel in 2009 regarding the international financial crisis, with the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates in 2009 on Iran, and with advisers in 2011 on the eurozone crisis.
The targeted phone numbers included those for the phones of senior officials at the Chancellery and included that of Ronald Pofalla, Merkels former chief of staff, WikiLeaks said.

Spying is a sensitive issue in Germany because of abuses committed during the Nazi and Communist eras. Revelations by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden about wide-ranging US espionage in Germany caused outrage when they surfaced.
The spying row has also been stirred by allegations that Merkels staff gave the German BND foreign intelligence agency a green light to help the NSA spy on European firms and officials.
The latest WikiLeaks release comes just over a week after it published a report showing the NSA wiretapped the communications of two successive French finance ministers and collected information on French export contracts, trade and budget talks.

New York stock exchange reopens after 'technical issue' forced shutdown
Stocks worth $28tn total were suspended for three and a half hours Wednesday, as authorities report glitch was not due to cyber terrorism or criminal activity
An options trader talks to a reporter about the New York stock exchange shutdown on Wednesday. Some traders were told the shutdown was due to an overnight software update.

The New York stock exchange reopened on Wednesday afternoon after a more than three-and-a-half-hour shutdown caused by a still unexplained internal technical issue.
Trading restarted at 3.10pm local time after all NYSE-listed stocks, worth a combined $28tn, were suspended at 11.32am because of technical problem which the authorities said was not a cyber-attack or the result of criminal activity.

The suspension is just one of seven NYSE closures since the founding of a predecessor exchange in 1817. The other closures were due to major world events, including the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln in 1865, the September 11 attacks in 2001 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012.
Tom Farley, president of NYSE, admitted that its not a good day, but still failed to explain what caused the problem beyond ruling out a cyber-attack. The outage was caused by a configuration problem in our system that needed fixing, Farley told CNBC.
We found what was wrong and we fixed what was wrong and we have no evidence whatsoever to suspect that it was external, he said. Tonight and overnight starts the investigation of what exactly we need to change. Do we need to change those protocols? Absolutely. Exactly what those changes are Im not prepared to say.
President Barack Obama had been briefed on the situation by Department of Homeland Security, which ruled out a cyber terrorism attack, the prospect of which has long worried politicians, regulators and traders. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said there was no indication that malicious actors were involved.
The FBI said there were no signs of suspicious activity and no law enforcement action was needed, but the NYSE had as of Wednesday night still not explained the cause of the shutdown.
Were currently experiencing a technical issue that were working to resolve as quickly as possible, a NYSE spokesman said. We are doing our utmost to produce a swift resolution, communicate thoroughly and transparently, and ensure a timely and orderly market re-open.
The NYSE updated traders about the halt in a series of tweets . The issue we are experiencing is an internal technical issue and is not the result of a cyber breach, the Twitter feed said. We chose to suspend trading on NYSE to avoid problems arising from our technical issue. NYSE-listed securities continue to trade unaffected on other market centers.
Mary Jo White, chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said the regulator was in contact with NYSE and are closely monitoring the situation and trading in NYSE-listed stocks.
Traders at the exchange said they had been told the problem was caused by an overnight software update. They told us they did some software updates overnight and tested it without problems, but this morning something happened, Peter Costa, president of Empire Executions, told the Wall Street Journal.
Costa, a floor trader, said NYSE executives had promised that trading would soon be restored. The exchange did not respond to requests for comment on the source of the technical problem.
Rich Barry, the floor governor of the NYSE, said: We have our best and smartest on the issue and hope that it is resolved ASAP.
As trading reopened at 3.10pm, later than a previously planned restart at 2.45pm, the NYSE tweeted: Trading on NYSE and NYSE MKT has resumed. All the major indices dipped when trading resumed, but had already been lower before the suspension in trading.
The stock market shutdown came just hours after United Airlines was forced to ground all of its US flights following a separate technical glitch it described as a automation issues. The airline, which has 4,935 daily departures, halted all flights for more than an hour on Wednesday morning. The Wall Street Journals website also went down due to a technical issue at the same time as the NYSE suspended trading.
The NYSE glitch came as Chinas stock markets continued to free-fall and with the Greek debt crisis still rattling European investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen 213 points when trading was halted, a fall of 1.2%.
Chinas stock markets, which lost 6% on Wednesday, have fallen more than 30% in the past three weeks after soaring 150% in the past year. Chinas regulators have blamed irrational selling and panic sentiment. The FTSE 100, which closed as normal just before the NYSE glitch occurred, closed up 0.9% to 6,491.

Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of BMO Private Bank, said he initially worried that Chinas woes had spread to the US when he heard the news and was relieved that it appeared to be a technical glitch. That said, it doesnt add a lot of confidence in the markets when investors dont have a lot to begin with, he said.
At about 1pm  an hour and a half after the trading halted  one NYSEs trader walked over to the barricades outside the exchanges Wall Street headquarters. As he strolled over reporters flocked to him. What? Do you want my autograph now? he asked. I cant comment. Whats scary is you asking me all these questions.
Rumours that the NYSE shutdown may have been caused by a possible cyber-attack were heightened by a tweet from hacking group Anonymous. Wonder if tomorrow is going to be bad for Wall Street  We can only hope, said a tweet posted from one of its main Twitter accounts early on Wednesday morning .

        <title>MH17 crash one year on: blame game continues over who shot down plane</title>

When she heard the bang, Natalia Voloshina rushed out of the small, one-storey house that passes for the village administration office in Petropavlovka, and looked up at the sky.
I could see these tiny black dots high in the sky, which started getting closer and bigger, and then things started falling around us, said the 43-year-old mayor of Petropavlovka, sitting at the same desk last week and recalling the afternoon of 17 July last year.
We realised they were pieces of plane, but first we assumed it was a military plane. The rebels had been shooting down Ukrainian military planes in the area in the preceding days.
The terrible truth soon became clear as dazed residents of Petropavlovka and other villages surveyed the fields around them. The remains were from Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 , which had apparently been shot out of the sky with a surface-to-air missile. All 298 people on the Amsterdam-Kuala Lumpur flight died.
In the nearby fields, there were human remains: sometimes mangled limbs, sometimes intact bodies. There were also all the accoutrements of modern air travel strewn on the ground.
MH17 map
People started bringing letters, medicines, suitcases, all kinds of personal possessions. Many people just came to be here and talk, because they were scared to go home. There were pieces of plane, overhead panels, everything. It was awful, said Voloshina.
It took rescue workers several days to fill bags with the bodies: black for whole bodies and green for parts. The cleanup mission was complicated by the fact that the plane fell in territory controlled by the pro-Russia rebels, where Ukraine had lost its sovereignty. The crash site was never properly sealed off, and rumours spread of looting and interference at the scene.
A year later, there has been no conclusive proof of who was responsible, though most evidence points to separatist forces shooting down the plane by accident with a Buk missile system, possibly brought across the border from Russia . Messages appeared on social media from an account linked to the rebels saying they had shot down a Ukrainian plane, but were swiftly deleted.
Russia has furiously denied accusations that pro-Moscow rebels were responsible. Russian media suggested the plane had been shot down by a Ukrainian fighter jet, and even produced witnesses who had supposedly seen the plane being tailed before being downed.

Mostly the pro-Russia forces denied ever having used a Buk, though one leader, Alexander Khodakovsky, told Reuters he believed the separatists had taken control of such a system from Russia.
That Buk I know about. I heard about it. I think they sent it back. Because I found out about it at exactly the moment that I found out that this tragedy had taken place, he said last summer.
In an interview with the Guardian in Donetsk last week, he was more circumspect. There was all the fuss about the Buks which were maybe there or maybe werent there, but honestly I cant say anything with clarity because I didnt see anything and didnt hear anything. Recently, in order to stop any insinuations, I have tried not to talk about that theme.
The head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk Peoples Republic was more blunt. I have said several times that we did not shoot down the Boeing, said Alexander Zakharchenko from his office in central Donetsk. We never had this kind of missile system. The Ukrainian army had a Buk. And so with a calm conscience we will happily receive any mission that wants to look into it.
But Khodakovsky pointed out that the rebels last summer were still made up of several disparate groups with no central command.
At that time it was chaotic here. One division didnt know what the others were doing. We were sitting here and were responsible for our tasks; those who were elsewhere had other tasks, he said.
Exactly who was controlling the Buk remains a mystery, although there is some evidence it came from across the border and may have been manned by a Russian crew. In the days after the crash, the Ukrainian security service released what it said were phone taps that implicated a number of separatist leaders, including Igor the Demon Bezler, who ran the town of Gorlovka at the time but has now left the region. An attempt by the Guardian to question Bezler ended with him threatening to kill the interviewer, but one of his former prisoners said Bezler could not have shot down the plane.

The recording they released was about another plane. I was there when he was talking about it, said Vasyl Budik, during a recent interview in the town of Slavyansk, where he works as an adviser to Ukraines defence ministry. He spent three months last summer as a prisoner of Bezler in Gorlovka. When he was told about the passenger plane later, he was going crazy; he understood that there would be major consequences for the rebels. But Bezler had nothing to do with it. He couldnt believe it.
In Moscow, amid public denials of involvement, diplomats scrambled to establish what had happened. A diplomatic source in Moscow said scheduled liaison meetings with counterparts in the Russian foreign ministry were held as planned all last year, with the exception of the week after the MH17 incident. It was almost as though the Russians wanted to get their story straight before meeting foreign officials, the diplomat said.
On 29 July, 12 days after the incident, an intriguing column appeared in the Kommersant newspaper by the long-time Kremlin pool correspondent Andrei Kolesnikov. With its odd tone purporting to read Vladimir Putins mind, it read like no other piece he had ever written.

If at the end of the day it turns out that the rebels really were responsible for this, this will radically change his attitudes to them, wrote Kolesnikov, in what appeared to be a carefully calibrated transmission of a message he had been asked to put across. Even if it turns out to be a fateful mistake. Innocent dead children  this would be a red line for him he could not cross. To cover up for those who did this knowing that they did it. No, this is a sin he could not countenance  Our policy of relations with the resistance fighters would be rethought once and for all. Vladimir Putin would ditch them.
That is not what happened, however. Instead, in the weeks after the tragedy, Russian involvement in east Ukraine appeared to intensify. In mid-August, the Guardian witnessed a convoy of armoured vehicles crossing the border under cover of night; shortly after, a group of paratroopers were captured by the Ukrainians (Russia said they had got lost), and in late August came the battle of Ilovaisk , where regular Russian soldiers are believed to have taken part, despite Moscows denials.
The Dutch-led investigation into the crash has proceeded slowly, with a full report not expected until October. The investigators are believed to have concluded that the plane was indeed shot down by a Buk missile. Perhaps in an attempt to pre-empt this, the version of a Ukrainian fighter jet has been ditched by Russian media and a press conference was recently held in Moscow by the manufacturers of Buk systems, Almaz-Antey, in which they claimed investigations showed the plane had been hit by a Buk missile system that only Ukraine possesses. Other investigations, such as by the citizen blogging team Bellingcat, have suggested the Buk came from Russia, and was operated by a Russian military crew.
There has been talk in the Netherlands and Malaysia about an international tribunal to establish criminal responsibility for the shooting down of MH17.

No route is 100% perfect, but this is the route that is by far the most preferred, the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said last week. We also have plan Bs if this approach doesnt work, both national and international, but this is the route that would be the best. And thats why we are exploring that possibility first of all.
Russia, however, has described the idea of a tribunal as premature. This week, the deputy foreign minister Gennady Gatilov tweeted: Russia opposed to a #MH17 tribunal as politically illogical, unnecessary and complicated to create.
On the ground, most of the debris has been cleaned up. In the village of Grabovo, where many of the remains of MH17 fell, and where even a few months ago pieces of the planes exterior could still be found scattered in the fields, everything has been cleared away. There is little sign of the horror of a year ago, although villagers occasionally turn up personal possessions in the field.
A proper clean-up of the plane wreckage only became possible in March, after a shaky ceasefire was signed in Minsk in February. Residents helped collect fragments and belongings from the crash, and in April a Dutch mission arrived to take away everything that had been collected in a big truck, paying residents for their time. Mdecins sans Frontires sent a psychologist to work with the children of the village. Even now, walking in the fields is not safe: just a few weeks ago in a neighbouring village, a six-year-old boy was killed by a mine.
At the spot where much of the wreckage lay, a small makeshift memorial has been created with a few bedraggled childrens toys and some candles laid on the ground. A placard is mounted on the nearby electricity pylon, bearing a poem in handwritten red block letters: Pause and pray / Feel the minutes pass / Here fell the Boeing / And in a terrible moment / Their lives were taken.
The rebel leader Zakharchenko said he did not know whether there were any events planned to mark the one-year anniversary. Why are you asking us? Ask the Netherlands. If they want to do anything well guarantee their safety, he said.
Voloshina, the mayor of Petropavlovka, said the father of a Dutch victim had visited the area in early June, and had taken soil from the fields in which MH17 had crashed to keep as a memory.

Outcry as Malaysia's human trafficking record brings praise from US
Country could now sign up to Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, but advocates say Malaysia continues to face human trafficking issues

The United States is upgrading Malaysia from the lowest tier on its list of worst human trafficking centres, US sources said on Wednesday, a move that could smooth the way for an ambitious US-led free-trade deal with the south-east Asian nation and 11 other countries.
The upgrade to so-called tier two watch list status removes a potential barrier to President Barack Obamas signature global trade deal.
A provision in a related trade bill passed by Congress last month barred from fast-tracked trade deals Malaysia and other countries that earn the worst US human trafficking ranking in the eyes of the US State Department.
The upgrade follows international scrutiny and outcry over Malaysian efforts to combat human trafficking after the discovery this year of scores of graves in people-smuggling camps near its northern border with Thailand.
The State Department last year downgraded Malaysia in its annual Trafficking in Persons report to tier three, alongside North Korea, Syria and Zimbabwe, citing limited efforts to improve its flawed victim protection regime and other problems.
But a congressional source with knowledge of the decision told Reuters the administration had approved the upgraded status. A second source familiar with the matter confirmed the decision.
Some US lawmakers and human-rights advocates had expected Malaysia to remain on tier three this year given its slow pace of convictions in human-trafficking cases and pervasive trafficking in industries such as electronics and palm oil.
This years full State Department report, including details on each countrys efforts to combat human trafficking, is expected to be released next week.
The State Department and the White House both declined to comment.
Obama visited Malaysia in April 2014 to cement economic and security ties. Malaysia is the chair of the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). It is seeking to promote unity within the bloc in the face of Chinas increasingly assertive pursuits of territorial claims in the South China Sea, an object of US criticism.
In May, just as Obamas drive to win fast-track trade negotiating authority for his trade deal entered its most sensitive stage in the US Congress, Malaysian police announced the discovery of 139 graves in jungle camps used by suspected smugglers and traffickers of Rohingya Muslims from Burma.
Malaysia hopes to be a signatory to Obamas legacy-defining Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which would link a dozen countries, cover 40% of the world economy and form a central element of his strategic shift towards Asia.
On 29 June, Obama signed into law legislation giving him power to push ahead on the deal.
Lawmakers are working on a compromise that would let Malaysia and other countries appearing on a US blacklist for human trafficking participate in fast-tracked trade deals if the administration verified that they have taken concrete steps to address the most important issues identified in the annual trafficking report.
The graves were found in an area long known for the smuggling of Rohingya and local villagers reported seeing Rohingya in the area, but Malaysias deputy home minister, Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar, has said it was unclear whether those killed were illegal migrants. The discovery took place after the March cut-off for the US report.
The State Department would have needed to show that Malaysia had neither fully complied with minimum anti-trafficking standards nor made significant efforts to do so to justify keeping Malaysia on Tier 3, which can lead to penalties such as the withholding of some assistance.
In its report last year, the State Department said Malaysia had reported 89 human-trafficking investigations in the 12 months to March 2014, down from 190 the previous year, and nine convictions compared to 21 the previous year.
In the latest year to March, Malaysias conviction rate is believed to have fallen further, according to human-rights advocates, despite a rise in the number of investigations. That reinforced speculation Malaysia would remain on tier three.
I would be stunned if they are upgraded. They have done very little to improve the protection from abuse that migrant workers face, said Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watchs Asia division.
This would seem to be some sort of political reward from the United States and I would urge the US Congress to look long and hard at who was making the decisions on such an upgrade.
Malaysia has an estimated 2 million illegal migrant labourers, many of whom work in conditions of forced labor under employers and recruitment companies in sectors ranging from electronics to palm oil to domestic service.
Last years report said many migrant workers are exploited and subjected to practices associated with forced labour. Many foreign women recruited for ostensibly legal work in Malaysian restaurants, hotels, and beauty salons are subsequently coerced into prostitution, the report said.
An administration official told Reuters in June that the White House had been working closely with the Malaysian government and stakeholders to fight the problem.
Among the 12 TPP countries, Brunei has also come under attack by human rights groups for adopting Islamic criminal law, which includes punishing offences such as sodomy and adultery with death, including by stoning. Vietnams communist government has been criticized for jailing dissidents.

Tunisia fears more potentially destabilising terrorist attacks such as the one that killed 38 foreign tourists last month, which is why it has imposed a state of emergency, the premier said on Wednesday.
Eight days after the 26 June shootings at the Mediterranean resort of Port El Kantaoui, president Beji Caid Essebsi decreed a state of emergency on Saturday for 30 days.
The rampage by a Tunisian student killed 30 Britons, three Irish nationals, two Germans, one Belgian, one Portuguese and a Russian, and was claimed by the Islamic State group.
We are engaged in a ferocious war against terrorism to protect lives and property, defend the republican regime  the civil state and its institutions, prime minister Habib Essid told parliament.
We would not have felt obliged to decree the state of emergency if we were not convinced that our country was facing numerous terrorist plans to destabilise the country.
He spoke of the gangs of terrorism, murder and crime preparing other operations  aimed at killing the maximum number of people, undermining morale and grinding the national economy to a halt.
Essid spoke as human rights groups warned the state of emergency should not suppress freedoms gained since the 2011 revolution that overthrew longtime dictator Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali .
But while saying whatever it takes, we will prevail over terrorism, this would not come at the expense of human rights, which will not be touched, Essid said.
Meanwhile, Tunisia will complete construction of a barrier along the Libyan border, from Ras Jedir on the Mediterranean coast to Dhiba, 186 kilometres (115 miles) to the southwest, a defence ministry official said.
The barrier, which will include berms and trenches, was announced after a terrorist attack on the national museum in Tunis in March killed 22 people, mostly tourists.
Work began on the barrier in April and will be completed by the end of the year, Belhassan Oueslati said.
The interior ministry said on Wednesday that 33 young Tunisians, mostly Islamic fundamentalists, have gone missing, with media saying that their families fear they have joined extremist groups in Libya.
Members of the group, which includes one woman, are aged between 16 and 35, it said, adding that their families reported them missing from the southern province of Tataouine.
The perpetrators of both the beach and museum attacks were said to have been trained in Libya .
The state of emergency grants the security forces exceptional powers. Among them, it allows the authorities to bar strike action and public meetings deemed dangerous to public order and to increase controls on the media.
The current state of emergency is not the first to be imposed in Tunisia since the revolution that sparked the Arab spring.

A serious drought in North Korea requires urgent action to prevent the deaths of children already weakened by widespread malnutrition, the United Nations childrens fund, UNICEF, warned on Thursday.
The situation is urgent, said UNICEF east Asia regional director Daniel Toole in a statement. But if we act now  by providing urgently needed expertise and prepositioning supplies  we can save lives
If we delay until we are certain of crop failures, it may well be too late to save the most vulnerable children.
North Korea is suffering what its official media described last month as the worst drought in 100 years that has severely affected the main rice-growing areas.
According to the UN World Food Program, early-harvest crops, mainly wheat and barley, have already been affected.
UNICEF said its personnel had recently met with local health officials in affected provinces who confirmed reports of significant increases in diarrhoea among children.
Lack of rain reduces access to clean water and undermines effective hygiene, putting childrens lives at risk, Toole said.
Concern about the impact of the drought is heightened by the existing poor nutritional status of many children in North Korea .
A 2012 study showed one-quarter of all North Korean children had symptoms of chronic malnutrition - a condition usually caused by a combination of unsafe water and poor sanitation, inadequate food intake and inadequate access to health services.
Toole said responding to the drought crisis was difficult given North Koreas isolation and the lack of funding for child-focused programs in the country.
But UNICEF has released prepositioned emergency supplies to help those in the worst-affected provinces, including water purification tablets, water storage containers and health supplies for children with acute malnutrition.

A court in Naples has sentenced former Italian premier and media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi to three years in prison for bribing a senator as part of a plot to destabilise a 2006-08 centre-left government.
Berlusconi, 78, will not have to serve the sentence as the statute of limitations expires later this year, well before a final ruling will have been reached on appeal.
It was a good trial, passionate, but in terms of consequences the imminent expiration date takes all the pathos out of the verdict, said prosecutor Henry John Woodcock after the sentence was delivered on Wednesday.
The case centred around bribes totalling 3m (2.16m) that were paid, through an intermediary, to Sergio De Gregorio, who admits accepting the money, in order to get him to leave the coalition of then premier Romano Prodi.
Related: Berlusconi cleared of underage sex charges and abuse of office for cover-up
The bribe was part of a plan to further weaken a fragile coalition and the defection was widely seen as hurting Prodis government, which collapsed in 2008, two years after the election. Berlusconis centre-right Forza Italia party won the resulting election and he served a third term as Italian premier until 2011.
The case marks the latest in a string of legal troubles for Berlusconi.
Earlier this year, he completed a community service order for corporate tax fraud but was cleared of having sex with an under-age dancer after judges ruled he could not have known she was a minor.
Berlusconi would have gone to prison for the tax fraud had he been younger but was allowed to serve his time by helping out once a week with dementia sufferers at an old peoples home.
In summing up the bribery case, prosecutor Vincenzo Piscitelli had told the court the 3m paid to the senator were a colossal economic investment made with the aim of achieving the sole goal that interested Berlusconi, who was obsessed by his desire to kick Prodi out and take his post.
The case will reach its statute of limitations in October or November at the latest, according to Italian media.

The wife of one of the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists murdered during the Paris terror attacks earlier this year is bringing legal action to identify failings in the security response.
Maryse Wolinski, whose husband Georges was one of those killed when two gunmen attacked the magazines offices in January, has reportedly started civil proceedings in France that will give her access to police files.
She told the French radio station RTL that she believed the police response was inadequate and she wanted to know the truth about how her husband died.
She is asking a judge to order an investigation into the response of the police, an inquiry that would not otherwise be carried out as a matter of course. The claim could lead to a criminal investigation into any failings identified.
Related: Charlie Hebdo: could security services have prevented Paris attacks?
Wolinski, a 72-year-old journalist, told RTL she wanted to understand the circumstances surrounding the attack, including the security arrangements.
Im not angry with those who are left behind, I am angry in general about what has happened. Were there failings? Yes, of course. Why was there no [police] van? Why did the GIGN (an elite armed police unit) not turn up?
There were numerous phone calls from different people in the building before the [gunmen] arrived at the editorial office. Therefore, one wonders why it was three officers on bicycles who arrived when the reports were of two armed men wearing hoods and masks, she said.
She said she would examine the police investigation files, which should be released to her within days, with her lawyer before deciding how to proceed.
A spokesman for the French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, did not respond to a request for comment. The French prime minister, Manuel Valls, said he understood that the victims families had questions, adding that it was their right to know the truth.

FBI chief wants 'backdoor access' to encrypted communications to fight Isis
Experts warn that magical thinking of a security flaw only the US government could exploit could easily be utilized by hackers, foreign spies and terrorists

The director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation has warned US senators that the threat from the Islamic State merits a debate about limiting commercial encryption  the linchpin of digital security  despite a growing chorus of technical experts who say that undermining encryption would prove an enormous boon for hackers, cybercriminals, foreign spies and terrorists.
In a twin pair of appearances before the Senates judiciary and intelligence committees on Wednesday, James Comey testified that Isiss use of end-to-end encryption , whereby the messaging service being used to send information does not have access to the decryption keys of those who receive it, helped the group place a devil on the shoulders of potential recruits saying kill, kill, kill, kill.
Comey said that while the FBI is thus far disrupting Isis plots, I cannot see me stopping these indefinitely. He added: I am not trying to scare folks.
Since October, following Apples decision to bolster its mobile-device security, Comey has called for a debate about inserting back doors  or front doors, as he prefers to call them  into encryption software, warning that  encryption threatens to lead us all to a very, very dark place .
But Comey and deputy attorney general Sally Quillian Yates testified that they do not at the moment envision proposing legislation to mandate surreptitious or backdoor access to law enforcement. Both said they did not wish the government to itself hold user encryption keys and preferred to engage communications providers for access, though technicians have stated that what Comey and Yates seek is fundamentally incompatible with end-to-end encryption.
Comey, who is not a software engineer, said his response to that was: Really? He framed himself as an advocate of commercial encryption to protect personal data who believed that the finest minds of Silicon Valley can invent new modes of encryption that can work for US law enforcement and intelligence agencies without inevitably introducing security flaws.
While the FBI director did not specifically cite which encrypted messaging apps Isis uses, the Guardian reported in December that its grand mufti used WhatsApp to communicate with his former mentor. WhatsApp adopted end-to-end encryption last year.
I think we need to provide a court-ordered process for obtaining that data, said Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat and former intelligence committee chair who represents Silicon Valley.
But Comeys campaign against encryption has run into a wall of opposition from digital security experts and engineers. Their response is that there is no technical way to insert a back door into security systems for governments that does not leave the door ajar for anyone  hackers, criminals, foreign intelligence services  to exploit and gain access to enormous treasure troves of user data, including medical records, financial information and much more.
The cybersecurity expert Susan Landau, writing on the prominent blog Lawfare, called Comeys vision of a security flaw only the US government could exploit  magical thinking .
Comey is aided in his fight against encryption by two allies, one natural and the other accidental. The natural ally is the National Security Agency director, Michael Rogers, who in February sparred with Yahoos chief of information security when the Yahoo official likened the anti-crypto push to  drilling a hole in the windshield , saying: I just believe that this is achievable. Well have to work our way through it. The Guardian, thanks to Edward Snowdens disclosures, revealed in September 2013 that the NSA already undermines encryption .
The less obvious ally is China, whom the FBI blamed last month for stealing a massive hoard of federal personnel data.
In May, China unveiled a national security law calling for  secure and controllable  technologies, something US and foreign companies fear is a prelude to a demand for backdoor entry into companies encryption software or outright provision of encryption keys.
Without ever mentioning his own FBI directors and NSA directors similar demands, Barack Obama castigated Chinas anti-encryption push in March. Obama has also declined to criticize efforts in the UK, the USs premier foreign ally, to undermine encryption. Prime minister David Cameron is proposing to introduce legislation in the autumn to force companies such as Apple, Google and Microsoft to provide access to encrypted data.
Under questioning from some skeptical senators, Comey made a number of concessions. When Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, asked if foreign countries would attempt to mandate similar access, Comey replied, I think they might. The director acknowledged that foreign companies, exempt from any hypothetical US mandate, would be free to market encryption software.
In advance of Comeys testimony, several of the worlds leading cryptographers, alarmed by the return of a battle they thought won during the 1990s Crypto Wars, rejected the effort as pernicious from a security perspective and technologically illiterate .
A paper they released on Tuesday, called Keys Under Doormats, said the transatlantic effort to insert backdoors into encryption was unworkable in practice, raise[s] enormous legal and ethical questions, and would undo progress on security at a time when internet vulnerabilities are causing extreme economic harm.
Asked by Feinstein if the experts had a point, Comey said: Maybe. If thats the case, I guess were stuck.
Kevin Bankston of the New America Foundation called into question the necessity of Comeys warnings that encryption would lead to law enforcement going dark against threats. Bankston, in a Tuesday blogpost, noted that the governments latest wiretap disclosure found that state and federal governments could not access four encrypted conversations out of 3,554 wiretapped in 2014 .
Yet Yates said both that the Justice Department was increasingly facing the encryption challenge and that she lacked the data quantifying how serious the challenge was. Yates told the Senate judiciary committee that law enforcement declined to seek warrants in cases of encrypted communications and did not say how often it made such a decision.

        <title>Greek island refugee crisis: local people and tourists rally round migrants</title>

On the northern coast of Lesbos, on the shore outside a famous local hotel, the footfall is usually limited to tourists. But on a recent morning, there was an unusual interloper. It was the president of the local village, Thanassis Andreotis, standing on the back of his white pick-up and tuggin the remains of a huge inflatable dinghy up from the beach below. Every morning, refugees use dinghies like this one to get from the Turkish shore  six miles away in the distance  to the Greek islands. And Andreotis saw it as his human duty to pick up the debris.
Related: Greece sees huge increase in migrants arriving by boat
Its way, way, way more than last year, Andreotis, a retired policeman said. Last year Id be doing this once a week. Now its once a day.
There have long been refugees trying their luck in these waters. But this year, amid the worlds biggest wave of mass-migration since the second world war, the numbers arriving on this isolated shoreline have reached record levels. Arrivals to the Greek archipelago are already 50% higher than for the whole of 2014  and have even now out-paced Italy. Lesbos, hitherto known as an exquisite tourist destination, has become the frontline  the Greek Lampedusa .
It could not have happened at a worse time. The Greek economy is close to collapse, with the European Central Bank threatening on Wednesday to withdraw its support for Greek banks by the end of the week.
Not that Andreotis blamed the refugees. Theyre hunted by their government and theyre running everywhere from horrible things, he said, hauling the last bits of dinghy up from the beach. And he said that lots of local people  some of whom are themselves descendants of migrants who left Turkey in 1922  agree with him. When he recently went into the centre of town with a megaphone and called for donations for the migrants, within 10 minutes there were four cars of supplies.
Related: Migrant boat crisis: the story of the Greek hero on the beach
With the central government unable to properly provide for many of its citizens, let alone migrants, this is how the humanitarian vacuum has often been filled.
Western reporting has centred on how the wave of migrants, sharing beaches with wealthy holidaymakers, have incensed foreigners and residents alike. There is certainly an awkward juxtaposition: further round this Lesbos beach, tourists sunbathed metres from an Angry Birds arm-band left on the beach by an infant migrant.
But there is also another story  one of locals, tourists and expats doing their best in tough circumstances to provide as warm a welcome as possible for a less fortunate kind of expatriate.

One of the first welcomes is provided by a British couple, Eric and Philippa Kempson, who live just metres from the closest beaches to Turkey. An eccentric long-haired artist who doesnt own a mobile, Eric Kempson is an unexpected connoisseur of Aegean smuggling networks. Originally from Windsor, hes lived here on the north coast of Lesbos for 16 years, earning his living by carving boutique wooden jewellery and sculptures .
Related: The Journey: A refugee's odyssey from Syria to Sweden
But over the past few months Kempson has developed a new specialism. Hes learned to spot the migrant dinghies from the moment they leave Turkey at dawn. Early each morning, he and his wife rush up and down the Greek shoreline, handing out water, dry clothes and food to the most vulnerable arrivals.
Usually there are two black boats that come out, mainly Afghans, Pakistanis, mostly men, Kempson said. About an hour later, we normally get three grey boats full of Syrians, and those are the ones we usually focus on because theyre full of women and children.
It has been an upsetting experience. When you see two-week-old children, people with cut feet, and people who havent eaten for days  you cant do anything. I hadnt cried in 20 years, and I am a hard bastard. But Ive cried so much in the last four months.
In logistical terms, the Greek government cannot cope either. The EU now wants to establish so-called quarantine zones for migrants on the Greek islands  but the government here already lacks the capacity to house the current wave of arrivals.
So in the south of the island, local activists have taken things into their own hands, turning an old scout camp into a makeshift, volunteer-run migrant reception centre called the Village of Altogether.

Driving migrants here from the beaches has been a legal grey area, and under a Greek law only lifted on Wednesday you could be accused of the crime of people-smuggling. But on the other hand, said a defiant Efi Latsoudis, one of the camps founders, we cannot stay watching hundreds of people with their children  walking, lying in the streets  and let them die there under the sun. Its impossible. Thats also a crime, to let someone die in the street.
In the north of the island, in the village of Molyvos, others have followed suit. An Australian whos lived here for four decades, Melinda McRostie, has turned a slip of land behind her well-known quayside restaurant into a makeshift migrant campsite. As soon as Kempson sends her the days headcount, her kitchen team at The Captains Table get to work preparing food for the islands newest guests, largely using food and supplies donated by tourists and locals.
Its obvious that its not something thats going to stop, said McRostie, of the wave of arrivals that have landed on Lesbos in recent weeks. So the only obvious thing to do is to do something about it.
McRostie can fit up to 180 people on the land behind her restaurant. This day, there are just 51 Afghanis and a single Pakistani here, sleeping off their exhaustion under the shade of a tarpaulin. Each of them lost all their remaining belongings earlier in the morning, after their boat started sinking a kilometre from Greece . Only quick work by the Hellenic coastguard saved their lives.
Suddenly there was water coming on the boat, and the engine stopped, remembered Tawfiq Amini, a former mechanic for the US army in Afghanistan, who fled home after the Taliban threatened him for working with foreigners. Everyone was shouting, the women were screaming. Everyone threw their bags in the water because we thought the boat was too heavy.

Doing her best for people like Amini every day, McRostie has found it emotionally tough. Ive stopped remembering names, she said, carrying two trays of sandwiches from her storeroom to the camp. Ive stopped asking stories. Its just too hard.
But there are some on Lesbos who never wanted to listen in the first place. Get them away from here, shouted another local restauranteur, pointing at the makeshift camp that backs on to his property. He was worried it will put off customers.
The same day, a vicious rumour circulated via social media that Muslim migrants had defecated in churches, and defiled their icons. It turned out to be a lie, but the takeaway is clear: there are those on the islands far right who want to stir up resentment of migrants. Golden Dawn, Greeces far-right party, is certainly quick to seize its chance. We will do everything we can to protect the Greek homeland against immigrants, the party says in response to the defecation story.
The abuse has sometimes got personal. Kempson said he receives threats because of his activism. During a conversation with the Guardian, an anonymous caller rang his house phone and breathed silently on the other end of the line. No matter where you are in the world, youll get these threats, he said. Youll have people with black hearts who hate human beings.
We cannot stay watching hundreds of people with their children and let them die there under the sun
Andreotis said it was a challenge to keep people united. There are people who think this will impact tourism, he says, the dinghy now safely squeezed into his pick-up. But by and large weve managed to make sure that people dont think theres anything to be afraid of.
One thing that has worried people is the risk of prosecution should they help a migrant. In order to apply for papers to leave for the mainland, migrants need to get to the islands capital, Mytilene, 40 miles to the south.
Until this week, if they landed on the island without being rescued by coastguards, they couldnt legally be driven to Mytilene. A law  only overturned on Wednesday  that equated assisting migrants with the act of people-smuggling meant that public buses wouldnt let them board, and locals were threatened with 100 (71) fines if they gave anyone a lift. Two were even arrested.
Kempson was explicitly warned by the police against driving anyone into town, and was also stopped helping people on the beaches themselves, lest he be accused of smuggling. The result has been that most migrants, in order to embark on the next stage of their journey to mainland Europe , have to walk 40 miles in the heat.
In the main bus stop at the edge of Molyvos, a group of Syrian Kurds who fled the advance of Islamic State 10 days ago were bracing themselves for the trek. The ban on giving lifts to migrants had not yet been lifted, and they were weighing up whether to walk  or to plea for local officials to make an exception. Us men can walk it, but not the women and children, said a 40-year-old, who called himself Abu Azab. Theres two pregnant women with us. Did we really risk death at sea for this?
Even in the face of censure, many locals have been doing their best to help under the radar  and even in full view. A few days ago, 41 drivers organised a convoy from Molyvos to Mytilene, each car carrying migrants in full violation of the law. The police did not dare arrest anyone.

Tourists have also been at it in their hire cars. Miel Lammens, a Belgian lab technician on holiday in Lesbos for the second time, has driven three groups of migrants southwards, under his own steam. He dropped them a short way from built-up areas, to avoid being detected. In the beginning I was worried  I thought, should I do this or not? Lammens said. But when you pass them and see the women and children, you think, yes, I should. I must do something. It costs me nothing.
Lammens also scoffed at the idea that migrants have ruined anyones holidays. The island has not changed because there are refugees, he said. Tourists can still lie on the beach without any problem. I havent seen any refugees begging. Theres no problem. If you go to Rome, people are begging for money. But here you dont have that. I have no idea why youd cancel your vacation.
There are even some who have devoted their holidays to helping the migrants. One couple flew in specifically to assist the Kempsons in their daily mission. Sabine Fischer, a German nurse, hadnt heard of the refugee influx before arriving on the island for a holiday but decided to help once she saw the situation. So every morning for a fortnight, she has helped McRostie prepare food and talk to the migrants. Somehow it just developed, Fischer said. They needed someone to help in the morning. I think: Im here, I dont have to do any work, I can help.
And McRostie hoped more people follow in Fischers wake  not necessarily to help at the camp, but simply to maintain the local economy. Greece already has one crisis, and now were having another one, said McRostie. We need tourists to support us.

Virgin Australia cancelled all flights from Australia to Denpasar on Friday as the volcanic ash cloud hovering over the region from Mount Raung continues to cause major headaches for Australians travelling to and from Bali.
The airline will make a decision later on Friday whether flights will depart Denpasar.
Jetstar and Virgin Australia cancelled their afternoon and evening flights on Thursday morning but left open the possibility of running later flights if conditions improved.

Jetstar said it will provide an update on Fridays flights to and from the country at 9.30am after the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre issues updated information about the ash cloud. It is also looking at putting on additional services in and out of Bali over the coming days if conditions improve.
Many flights between Australia and Bali have been grounded since Wednesday night because of volcanic eruptions from Mount Raung.
Indonesia AirAsia has advised in a statement that its flights have been rerouted away from the affected areas and said it was keeping a close eye on updates from relevant agencies.
On Thursday evening, Ngurah Rai international airport, Lombok Praya international airport and Juanda international airport were still operating as normal.

The Ladies in White, made up of the wives and relatives of former political prisoners, visited the Vaticans mission in Cuba to submit their request.
Group leader Berta Soler said she has passed along information about human rights in Cuba to Vatican officials, including evidence of ladies and activists who have been victims of repression in recent weeks.
She has also expressed concern that the government will prevent dissidents from attending the popes masses while in the communist country.
Ladies in White is the only group in the single-party country permitted to stage weekly marches in a specific area.
The Ladies in White was created after the so-called black spring of 2003, when Cuban authorities rounded up 75 dissidents and sentenced them to lengthy prison terms.
During his visit to the island in September, the pope is scheduled to give two outdoor masses, one in Havana.
He is also set to meet with President Ral Castro, who recently began a warming of ties with the US alongside President Barack Obama, after decades of enmity.
The Vatican was a key interlocutor in the secret negotiations that preceded the thaw.
Pope Francis will travel to the US after the Cuba visit.

Against a backdrop of violence and civil war, ongoing since 2013 , South Sudans residents prepare to celebrate the fourth anniversary of their independence.
In 2011, full of hope for the future, the country seceded from neighbouring Sudan, a move that many hoped would bring an end to the conflict which had raged between southern rebels and Omar al-Bashirs Khartoum government for more than two decades .
But two years in, conflict erupted. Soldiers loyal to president Salva Kiir began fighting those serving his rival former vice-president Riek Machar. Thousands have died, and more than 2 million people have been forced to flee their homes.

Fought across ethnic lines  Kiirs Dinka against Machars Nuer  the conflict has torn apart the wave of promise that brought the country into being.
But in the refugee camps in neighbouring Uganda, displaced South Sudanese civilians living in the fast-expanding Nyumanzi camp havent given up hope for their home country, and share what theyd like to see change.
Paom Amum
Do I even have the right to say a word? Wont I get killed or arrested? All I can say is that I dont care about who leads anymore, all I want is a good life. I am tired of losing my people, property and always being on the move from place to place seeking refuge. I love my country and I wish it the best.

What South Sudanese need is rehabilitation, not just power struggles and leadership. But from what I see here in the camp, a majority of youth dont want to work or develop, even if there are opportunities. If there be a new government then they should focus on programmes that teach the citizens skills.
To me, this is what matters, not the leadership.

I dont like the current government but I cant say why because I dont want to get a bullet in my head.

If I say Salva Kiir should rule, Machar will keep fighting and if I say Machar rules, who knows, Salva Kiir may also take arms and enter the bush to fight Machar off the top seat.
All I want is peace, I dont want to take sides because Im not a tribalist. I love all the leaders as long as they advocate for peace.

The current regime is on the brink of failure. The Juba regime has failed the people of South Sudan from day one when it started to massacre innocent civilians... There will be no election under [Salva Kiirs] leadership and if that happens I definitely wouldnt come back for it, as Im a target due to my ethnicity.
The current regime is a Dinka regime. It does not represent the diversity of South Sudan .

Once a dream destination for children from across the Soviet Union, the huge Crimean childrens camp Artek is one of the Kremlins most prized projects in the region.
But as top Russian officials, including the prime minster, Dmitry Medvedev, flew in from Moscow last month to celebrate Arteks 90th anniversary , several miles away residents of the small seaside town of Gurzuf were taking a grievance all the way to the president, Vladimir Putin, himself.
Artek launched an ambitious development plan in August last year, backed by 22bn roubles (250m) in investment from the Russian state. But its neighbours along the coast claim that the camp was illegally granted 10 hectares of the towns cherished seaside property after the annexation of Crimea last year.

In a campaign to reclaim the land, a grassroots protest movement of a kind rarely seen in Russia has taken the grievance to the courts.
We tried to appeal to Putin over peoples heads. He has been known to stand up for the rights of minorities, said Yury Skorik, Gurzuf resident and unofficial leader of the protests.
Illegal
Artek occupies an area larger than Monaco, camp director Alexei Kasprzhak noted in a special edition of the Russian history magazine Diletant . But Gurzuf residents say only 208 hectares ever belonged to the camp. An additional 10 hectares, they claim, were added and illegally signed away when the new Crimean authorities handed Artek over to Russia.
To locals, the land is known as known as Gurovskiye Kamni. It slopes down from Gurzufs central road to a small pebble beach that has been a favoured spot for decades.
They say Artek previously leased Gurovskiye Kamni under an agreement with the local authorities. Flanked by youth camps on either side, the area was never built on and visitors were allowed to come and go as they pleased when the territory was under Ukrainian rule, they say.
But since the annexation , guards employed by Artek  often armed, locals claim  have started patrolling the camps borders and barring access to anyone without a special permit.
Its about time [the residents of Gurzuf] get used to the idea that in a place where children are vacationing, it is inappropriate to walk your dog, drink beer under every shrub and build campfires, Kasprzhak told Moscow-based tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets .
For residents, Arteks prohibitive policing is too restrictive. We want to be able to look at the Black Sea, not through a gate [and] not past guards or policemen. Everyone should have free access, one resident said.

Not our job
The camps management and the protesters agree on one thing: the fate of Gurzufs residents should not lie in Arteks hands.
[The issue of residents access to the coast] is not Arteks problem but that of the towns municipal authorities, Kasprzhak said .
The anger among Gurzufs residents reflects the resentment felt by many Crimeans at seeing their seafront steadily swallowed up by resorts and other businesses. Despite a slump in visitors since the annexation, Russian news channel RIA Novosti has projected 125bn roubles will be spent by tourists in the peninsula this summer.
With the landbridge to Ukraine sealed by border guards, sanction-hit Crimea is looking to Russian visitors to keep its hotels full. In March Crimeas tourism minister Yelena Yurchenko said the region was expecting to welcome 4.3 million tourists  most of them from Russia.

Residents say that local authorities have been too scared to pick a fight with the Kremlin-favoured camp since it came into Russias possession. Artek is a hefty figure on the chessboard. No one wants to lock horns with them. Theyre scared they will lose, Skorik said.
The camps 35-year old CEO and director, Alexei Kasprzhak, brought in just months after the annexation has big plans for the Russian resort. The camps projected attendance turnover for 2020 is 40,000 teenagers, Moskovsky Komsomolets reports  roughly double the amount number of visitors recorded in 1990, a year before the fall of the Soviet Union.
In 10 years, in every grade of every Russian school there will be at least one Artekovite, Kasprzhak wrote in his article for Diletant.
Outlining his plans to build a second school, the camps director said it could become an alternative to traditional schools that will enable teachers and students to experiment with new teaching techniques and technologies.
To complete its ambitious development plan, Artek will need all the space it can get. But with a natural barrier in the form of the Ayu-Dag mountain to the camps east, Artek has little room to grow other than west  toward Gurzuf.
Adding insult to injury, residents have seen little to no benefit from the 22bn rouble injection of state funds meant to resuscitate Artek.
A 140m rouble tender to provide the camp with linen and uniforms was given to Russian sportswear giant Bosco , rather than a local company, it was reported , and other sources claim that 1,500 workers risk losing their jobs under the new management.
[Artek] will become a little piece of heaven. But what about those of us right next to heaven? Skorik asked.

From Castro and Gagarin, to Putin
With the camps motto Artekovite forever in their memories, generations of Russians who stayed at the Black Sea resort in their youth applauded the camps return after Putin signed the Crimea annexation from Ukraine in March last year  Moskovsky Komsomolets went so far as to call Artek the fairytale camp where dreams come true.
Founded in 1925, the camps stated aim was to educate the citizens of a socialist society, and is described by historian Margaret Peacock as the most popular of all Soviet summer resorts.
Hosting elite members of the Young Pioneers, the Communist Party youth group, the resort also received dignitaries from Fidel Castro to Ho Chi Minh to Indias first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, who all visited the camp in its heyday . Even Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin went several times between 1961 and 1967, on his final visit inaugurating the camps own space museum .
Making use of a rising wave of Russian patriotism  and the nostalgia Artek evokes  Gurzufs residents have appealed directly to Putin to turn Gurovskiye Kamni, the contested stretch of beachfront, into a public park in honour of the Soviet Unions victory over Nazi Germany (Gurzuf is in the province of Yalta, where Stalin met with the other allied leaders at the close of the second world war to discuss Europe post-Hitler).

But with no sign of a direct intervention by the Russian president, Skorik says that he and his supporters are now taking the matter to court. A lawsuit will be filed against the federal body that registered Artek as owning 218 hectares of land instead of 208 hectares any day now, according to Skorik.
In the meantime, Arteks management has promised to allow residents access to the contested area until the next summer season  a concession Gurzufs residents see as a sign of future victory.

Despite what its media machine and PR offensive would have you think, Kazakhstan continues to stand as one of the pre-eminent post-soviet dictatorships, where political opposition and independent media is routinely stifled.
Last week, the remnants of the countrys remaining independent press took another blow. A judge in the countrys largest city, Almaty, found Nakanune.kz , one of the few media voices bucking the state line, guilty of libel .
Citing the outlets corruption investigations into the city of Almatys construction industry , the court found that the outlet has caused undue harm to the industrys financial backers. In addition to the verdict, the court levied a $107,000 fine against the domain name owner, Guzyal Baydalinova.
This is a disturbing shift for a country that enjoyed some semblance of independent, if relatively constrained, media through the first two decades of president Nursultan Nazarbayevs rule. But everything changed following the 2011 Zhanaozen massacre , in which government forces gunned down over a dozen unarmed protesters.
The authorities promptly blamed nefarious outside forces for the protests, and in the four years since the massacre Kazakhstans independent media scene has shrunk from a stable, if small, coterie, to one on life support.
Outlet upon outlet , from newspapers to television, includingRespublika, Vzglyad, Stan TV have disappeared, with authorities citing connections to foreign bogeymen as the reason for their demise.
Outlet upon outlet, from newspapers to television have disappeared, with authorities citing foreign connections
Indeed, Nakanune.kzs closure follows on the heels of this years closure of Adam Bol , an independent weekly castigated for sharing information not vetted by the government in the capital, Astana.
Authorities claimed that an article published by Bol in late August 2014 about the conflict in Ukraine contain[ed] attributes of war propaganda and agitation, violating article 20 of Kazakhstans constitution, which prohibits propagandising for war.
Rights group Freedom House says that although the countrys constitution guarantees freedoms of speech and the press, the government severely restricts them in practice.
In 2014, the group said the Kazakh authorities had inflicted legal restrictions, prohibitive libel and defamation judgments, censorship, and intimidation on journalists and news outlets.
Some international bodies have taken notice, most notably the UN. Between recent criticisms from Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Rapporteur Maina Kiai, who blasted Kazakhstans lack of freedom of expression , the UN has proven one of the few groups willing to call Kazakhstans regime for what it is.

Island of stability?
But the countrys PR machine is determined to show the world a very different picture. State media, lobbyists and politicians have been presenting Kazakhstan as an island of stability in a sea of political chaos.
Its charm offensive even extends to a fully backed world-class cycling team , named after its own capital city, home to big-name riders including last years Tour de France winner Vincenzo Nibali .
With Islamist insurgencies spilling over from Afghanistan, and while Russia and China bully and blunder to the north and the east, Kazakhstan, is portrayed as a place providing freedoms for both citizens and visitors, untainted by the surrounding turmoil.
Kazakhstans officials have even taken to trying to convince western policymakers that the countrys democracy is functioning  despite Nazarbayev now ruling for more than 30 years  and that its religious tolerance stands as a beacon in the Islamic world.
Related: Kazakhstan election avoids question of Nazarbayev successor
But the reality is very different. Kazakhstan remains a nation where an autocrat can comfortably swing 98% of the vote in an election, while political opponents sit in jail , and freedom of assembly remains nearly non-existent.
Even freedom of religion, which the authorities so eagerly play up for foreign observers, is a stretched truth. While the country hosted a Congress of World Religions last month, it remains one of only 33 nations cited by the US Commission on International Religious Freedom monitored for serious religious freedom violations.

'The west is too paranoid about Russia's information war'
Before stepping up the propaganda arms race America and Europe should realise how clumsy the Kremlins media campaign really is, argues Mark Galeotti

There is something of a panic in the west at the moment over fears that it is losing the information war with Russia .
On one level, this may be true. The Kremlin is undoubtedly engaged in a multi-front, multi-message, multimedia campaign to undermine America and Europe .
Everything from the pre-eminence given tin-hatted conspiracy theorists on the English-language state TV channel RT to the infamous troll houses and the efforts to demonise figures such as US State Department spokeswoman, Jen Psaki , testify to this.

But before the west turns to info-warriors of its own, it ought to consider the weaknesses and consequences of the Russian campaign.
It is, primarily, a negative strategy. If anything, opinion polls show dwindling trust in and goodwill towards Russia around the world. Pew Research Center surveys found that between 2013 and 2014 negative views of Russia rose from 54 to 74% in Europe, with the countrys reputation failing to improve in any corner of the globe.
Russias aim, though, is not so much to accumulate its own soft power as to undermine the wests ability to act against it. At that, it has certainly had some success.
Many Nato members are becoming increasingly worried about the risk of being sucked into a wider conflict with the former superpower. At a time when their leaders are talking about the need for a tougher line against Russian expansionism , their electorates are uncomfortable. The sharpest indication of this split is in Germany, where many say they would not want to support a Nato partner facing Russian aggression.
The Russian information war has helped hide the ground truths of Ukraine within a cloud of rumour, innuendo, misinformation and spin. Whatever one may think about the Maidan protests that brought down the former government, the current government in Kiev was elected and is not a neo-fascist junta, as is often suggested
Whatever one may think about the Crimean vote to join Russia , the annexation was illegitimate under international law, and the fact that this continues to be debated attests to the successes of the Russian media campaign.
Related: EU to counter Russian propaganda by promoting 'European values'
But lets not assume that all of the innuendo and debate is a product of the Russian info-war, or that the Kremlin is a grandmaster of the memetic chessboard. These debates also reflect an underlying malaise of politics, leadership and legitimacy in the west.
We are willing to doubt the mainstream not because RT exhorts us to question more, as its slogan goes, but because we are already ready to believe that our leaders, our power structures and even our media lie to us.

We find ourselves exposed to conspiracy theories and sensationalist nonsense not because of the Russians so much as our own competitive media environments and the speed with which a funny, compelling or exciting lie or half-truth can be reposted, retweeted and re-reported around the world  outdistancing any fact-checking or sober analysis.
The most powerful counter to lies is not other lies, but the truth
Mark Galeotti
In this climate, the west is simply suffering from its own internal contradictions. The Russians have been able to exploit them but they have also often demonstrated themselves to be counter-productively clumsy.
Those troll farms whose sophistication is often vaunted by western alarmists have become a story in their own right  and anyone wanting to present the Russian perspective in an online forum now runs the risk of being taken for one.
While on the one hand attempts are made to woo German opinion, on the other Russian hackers break into Bundestag computers  probably gaining no more than trivial intelligence but undoing whatever work the media may have done.
In short, neither the Kremlin nor western governments should assume that the info-sphere is a simple battlefield on which disciplined forces wheel and charge. It is, at best, a cacophonous forum where umpteen rival voices struggle to be heard.
Russia may have a megaphone, but this just means that when its message is laughable or offensive it can alienate more people at once.

Now the European Union has launched an East StratCom Team to spread its values within the EU and the so-called eastern neighbourhood countries, including Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, and Russia itself. But an organisation currently struggling to sell itself to sceptical audiences from England to Greece should be cautious about entering into full-blown information warfare.
As soon as such organs are created the temptation is to use them to spin and spread messages that edge closer and closer into outright propaganda. This mistake was made in the early years of the cold war, before the west realised that the most powerful counter to lies is not other lies, but the truth.
Yet the wests weaknesses are also its strengths: a plurality of opinions, an innately sceptical attitude, a willingness to revisit old assumptions. In the short term these may create vulnerability but in the long term they bring resilience.
The infamous declaration by Dmitry Kiselyov, the journalist who heads the state news agency Rossia Segodnya, that objectivity is a myth that is being imposed on us could stand as the motto of Russias information warfare campaign  or perhaps some day as its epitaph.

North Koreas state-run KCTV network has used the popular  birthday dog  meme that swept the internet in 2010 to criticise America and its extravagances.
As seen in a video released on YouTube , KCTVs talk show Todays World used the picture of Riley during a segment about poor conditions in the US.
KCTV commentator Lee Chung-song claimed in the clip that American billionaires are buying $15,000 dog collars for their pets, paying for dog hotels and spas or even hosting expensive birthday parties for their canines, such as the one enjoyed by Riley, while many homeless people are forced to live in boxes, he said.
None of this is untrue, strictly speaking, but it seems the TV channel may have taken the images a little too literally.
Kim Heung-kwang, director of NK Intellectuals Solidarity, said: I have heard of cases where DPRK media producers used the wrong pictures on a movie or newspaper, but this is the first time seeing it on the internet.
Riley went viral in 2010 after his owner posted the picture on her Facebook page. The picture received thousands of views when a family friend republished it Reddit. Riley became known for his smile, which users said looked like the canine was under the influence of marijuana.
The TV clip also shows images of dogs apparently at a tea party, and another surrounded by glasses of champagne, used by the programme as further evidence of Americas deep inequality.
The current affairs programme emphasises the gap between the rich and poor in America  criticising the country for exploiting the human rights agenda against North Korea while failing to shelter its own homeless population.
This incorrectly used image clearly shows the North Korean TV producers hardship in getting the right data file for their show, Kim said.
If the TV producers cant find the data they want to use, it will lead to miscommunication and mistakes, like using the wrong meme, Kim said.
KCTV also used a picture of Giant George , the worlds tallest dog, though his inclusion shows no clear relation to the shows theme on inequality.

How second-hand clothing donations are creating a dilemma for Kenya
Resale of charity shop rejects has destroyed local textile industry but a proposed ban on the importation of used garments risks putting thousands out of work

When a fire razed East Africas biggest second-hand clothes market in Nairobi last week , the deputy president, William Ruto, rushed to the scene to assure traders that the government would do everything to help them to rebuild their destroyed stalls.
But perhaps a more important question Ruto should have answered is whether Gikomba market will be in business a year from now if a proposed ban on the importation of second-hand clothes into east Africa is approved.
In January, east African head of states suggested that Kenya , Uganda and Tanzania should stop importing used clothes in an effort to revive the local textile industry.
Kenya alone imports around 100,000 tonnes of second-hand clothes, shoes and accessories a year  many of which were originally donated to charity shops in the west. According to Oxfam, more than 70% of the clothes donated globally end up in Africa .
The items [charity] shops fail to sell or which they reject are considered for resale elsewhere, says Ian Falkingham, who manages an Oxfam-owned outlet in Senegal, Frip Ethique. Items which are in good condition and suitable for warmer climates are exported to Africa.
According to Oxfam , more than 70% of the clothes donated globally end up in Africa
This second-hand clothes chain sees, for example, a Forever 21 dress once worn by a young woman in London find its way into the wardrobe of a university student in Kenya. University of Oxford sweatshirts, I love London T-shirts, hoodies emblazoned with the star spangled banner or the Union Jack  and even the Confederate flag  are common wear for people who have never set foot in the UK or the United States.
But if the ban goes through, Kenyans will be compelled to buy locally produced clothes, giving textile manufacturers a chance to reclaim the market they lost to cheap imports from abroad.
Death of an industry
The decline of Kenyas textile industry dates back to the early 1980s, when market liberalisation policies spearheaded by the World Bank opened up the local economy to second-hand clothes. Previously, they had been distributed for free among the poor.
But the superior quality and originality of the clothes soon caught the eye of the young urban population, creating a demand that led to the collapse of many of Kenyas once robust textile companies, among them Rift Valley Textiles (Rivertex) and Kisumu Cotton Mills (Kicomi).
According to local media reports , 500,000 people were employed in the textile industry in the 1980s. Today, that number has fallen by more than 96% to around 20,000.
Banning the importation of used clothes is the governments latest effort to save an industry that is all but extinguished  and is intended to try to recover some of those lost jobs.
But, paradoxically, a ban could devastate another group of Kenyans who depend on the second-hand clothes trade to make a living.
William Ngonga, who sells used clothes at Gikomba, is aware of the possible ruling that could destroy the business his family has spent the past two decades building. I am in this business with my parents, I joined them 10 years ago just after finishing university. Its the only work I know, he says.
Ngonga says the business imports an average of two containers of clothes a month, for which they pay 16,700 in tax. The containers are offloaded from ships at the port town of Mombasa from where they are transported by road to Gikomba market.
A glorious, chaotic ecosystem

Gikomba is the ground zero of second-hand clothes in Kenya, and its from here that merchandise is redistributed to retailers all over the country.
Unapologetic for its mess of noise, dust and a confusing maze of timber, iron sheets and cardboard stalls, clothes hang from the stalls in a wild cacophony of colour and design.
If the clothes are not on hangers, they are bundled into giant heaps which the sellers invite buyers to burrow into to find what they are looking for. Often, the best dresses or blouses are buried at the bottom of the pile.
Buyers and sellers jostle for space in the cramped, often muddy, lanes, where the set price of goods is usually so low that it is ridiculous to bargain for anything cheaper. Even so, the more industrious sellers can be heard shouting themselves hoarse, advertising bargains designed to lure even the most reluctant of buyers.
Gikomba pulses with a spirit borne of genuine camaraderie: conversation and laughter punctuate the exchanges between the buyers and sellers.
It is a glorious, chaotic ecosystem that has survived catastrophe after catastrophe, including a terror attack in May last year that killed 12 people and more fires than the traders can count.
Ngonga says he directly employs 15 people, most of whom are casual labourers, and is afraid that they might all be left without a source of income if the East Africa Community goes ahead with the ban.
If these people are deprived of wages, they might turn to crime and contribute to making Nairobi an unsafe city
Charles Kuria
I have a degree in commerce which I have never used, but I might be forced to fall back on it if the ban goes through. I am not particularly excited to have to join the overcrowded job market and become a paper pusher because I really love this job, he says.
And paid employment of another kind is unlikely to match his current earnings: Ngonga reveals that each container imported at 38,574 brings in a profit of over 90%.
Charles Kurias store is one floor above Ngongas. It is bigger, and filled floor to ceiling with bales of clothes.
Kuria has had this store for almost two years, but he has been in the businessmuch longer, starting from the bottom as a hawker selling a few pieces on the streets to a big time wholesaler who now only sells in bales to retailers.
He imports his stock directly from the UK, the US, Canada and Belgium.
Although Kuria is reluctant to discuss his profit margins, he admits to living a comfortable life where money has ceased to be a worry. His is a business that has a sizeable staff, with four people employed permanently and up to 20 casuals each time new stock comes in.
He says the real casualties of a ban would be the casual workers who depend on odd jobs to earn a living.
If these people are deprived of an opportunity to make honest wages, they might turn to crime and contribute to making Nairobi an unsafe city, says Kuria.
Striking a balance
Former Kenya Association of Manufacturers boss Betty Maina is cognisant of the risk that comes with cutting off the second-hand clothes business without a fall back plan for the hundreds of thousands it employs.
In an article for a local media company , Maina says that it is possible to grow the local textile industry without taking jobs from the people who need them the most.
Granted, the mitumba sector is a source of employment and many people earn their livelihood from the business. Measures that would shut down the flourishing trade at a go would not be very welcome.

But why not streamline activities in the sector in such a way that the local textile industry is able to reap the benefits of providing quality products at an affordable price and at the same time providing thousands of jobs directly and millions more in downstream activities? she asks.
The thousands involved in the second hand clothes trade will know their fate once the East Africa leaders meet for the November summit, during which the issue is expected to come up.
In the meantime, it remains to be seen how the government will walk the tightrope of reviving the local textile industry without annihilating Gikomba  and the people that thrive on it.

Nearly 1,400 North Koreans were publicly executed between 2000 and 2013, according to new research, which suggests that the number of these deaths peaked at 160 in 2009. Further increases after 2013 have also been reported.
The Korean Institute for National Unification, funded by the South Korean government, said in its annual white paper on human rights in North Korea that 1,382 executions took place in public in the 13-year period.
The figures, which cannot be independently verified, were said to be based on in-depth interviews with North Korean defectors and confirmed by witnesses in the country. The number of executions carried out away from the public eye is also impossible to ascertain.
North Korean media have reported only two executions in 2014 and none so far this year, according to Cornell Universitys Death Penalty Watch research group. During 2009, only one was officially reported.

But the South Korean newspaper Joongang Daily reported in late 2013 that thousands of North Koreans had been forced to attend executions by firing squad held in stadiums, the first known large-scale public executions under Kim Jong-uns leadership.
Public executions are considered to be a way to keep the population in line. According to witness testimonies from the DPRK, public executions for watching or distributing South Korean films and drug smuggling have increased in recent years, as well sentences for crimes against the regime. Many more are punished by being sent to work-camps, with Amnesty International estimating that 200,000 North Koreans are in prison .
North Korea does not allow access to human rights groups, but an Amnesty report confirms the 2013 spike in executions, claiming that at least 70 death sentences were carried out in the DPRK, from a total of 776 around the world.
Amnesty said the actual number was likely to be far higher, but even without taking this into account North Korea , a country with 0.3% of the worlds people, carries out nearly 10% of its confirmed executions.
This total is still less than Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, which account for 80% of the worlds confirmed executions between them. The US executed 761 people between 2000 and 2013, according to the Death Penalty Information Centre , but many countries, most notably China, refuse to reveal the number of people sentenced to death by the state.
Since 1996, the South Korean unification institute has published annual statistics on executions. This years figures were based on testimonies of 221 North Korean defectors, selected based on demographics and background, of the total 1,396 escapees who came to South Korea last year.

Tehrans Valiasr Street is a long, winding road with sycamore trees and streams that were once fed all year round by the cool waters of the Alborz mountains  when there was enough snow, and when there was enough water. Known as the longest street in the Middle East, Valiasr spans the city from south to north, and reminds you that Tehran is almost surrounded by mountains, like a bird in cupped hands, as fragile and as transitory.
To walk up this street on any given day, from the deep south to the posh north, is to see history etched on walls and windows. Tehran is a city that has much to remember  when it is able.
Scattered along Valiasr, in random corners, one can find some of the citys most ignored treasures: 19th-century Qajar and 20th-century Pahlavi-era homes, with their distinctive architecture of colourful gardens and deep basements. But make sure to look in the most unlikely places.

In south Valiasr, north of Mowlavi Street, behind a large sign for the Sheep Butchers Union, is the house of Anis al-Doleh , favourite wife of the Qajar king, Nasser al-Din Shah. Her story is a real-life rags to riches tale: the orphaned daughter of shepherds, the shah met her on a hunting trip and brought her to Tehran. She gradually rose to become the most prominent wife and raees-e andarooni, executive chief of the harem.
While the house was registered as a national landmark in 2002, it still operates as the headquarters of the sheep butchers union, and this is not necessarily a bad thing. At least it has guaranteed the house a life.

The home is not large, but rosy and welcoming. A round blue pool dominates the garden, reflecting the trees and wall carvings  as well as the hideous three-storey building next door. The first floor is sealed off as storage space. The second (and main) floor houses the offices of the union and they kindly allow me inside. Delicate carvings of flowers and birds in pastel colours fill every room, all juxtaposed to the sound of sheep auction schedules and slaughterhouse prices that men are yelling over the phone.
A high aluminium pyramid roof indicates that once not long ago it snowed heavily in this area. These days one forgets the snow that covered the entire city throughout winter, even a decade ago.
Tehran is not associated with ancient history: popular opinion knows it as the city of the Qajars and Pahlavis. But as recent excavations suggest, Tehran was settled 7,000 years ago. Even so, the Qajar and early Pahlavi eras shaped modern Tehran in giving it a distinct architecture. Divergent art once defined Irans cities: from Qeshm, to Kashan, to Astara, each built according to its locality, climate and artisans. Today, Tehran, like those other cities and more, has been disfigured throughout.
In the Tehran of the most recent centuries, elaborate houses had intricate basements underground, and aab anbar  a deeper basement for water storage. No matter how lavish or simple the home, it almost always treasured a blue pool in the yard around which fruit trees were grown. Windows and doors were wooden, and intricate carvings filled the walls with patterns that became more complex the higher the financial standing of the owner.
Few of these homes remain today, unless renovated by a major organisation. The luckier ones were turned into museums and art houses. Few like the home of Anis al-Doleh were the odd in the bunch that were kept intact but overtaken by random associations.
As recently as the 1930s, Deh-e Vanak in northern Tehran was a farming quarter in the midst of the city. Today, nearby Vanak Square is one of citys most congested areas, but walk towards the village, and you will still find homes built in the 1920s, 1930s and even earlier. Why have they not been turned to apartment buildings in this frenzy? One wonders.
Ali Vanaki comes from a family that has lived in the village for hundreds of years. We were farming in this area for centuries, then Reza Shah came along and gave the entire village to his prime minister, Mirza Hassan Mowstofiyol Mamalek. We refused to leave, but many of these homes do not have proper documents, even to this day.
Despite this, they are still sold for up to 17m tomans (3,500) per square metre in the winding streets, and 30m tomans (6,000) for homes with bigger gardens.
Mowstofiyol Mamaleks grandchildren, in Vanak, remain some of the only old royalty that still live in their grandfathers orchards and Qajar-era home. The house is sealed off with high brick walls, but is available for wedding photographs at staggering sums. From the trees that peek out behind the walls, one can only marvel at the history of this place. Mowstofiyol Mamalek sold part of the village land to the industrialist millionaire Gashtasb Firouzgar, who in turn sold it to Tehran municipality.

Mowstofiyol Mamalek came from a long lineage of landlords and government treasurers, so they were awarded that title a century before his birth.
Today, this piece of land is called Baqh-e Irani (the Iranian garden) and is one of the countrys most exquisite open spaces, covering 3.4 hectares. It is a public park but, as its name suggests, with streams and old orchard trees. Tehran municipality spent a billion tomans on the tulips here alone, says Vanaki.
Much of Tehran was once khooneh baqhi (houses within fruit orchards), of which the remaining trees in Vanak village and Valiasr Street are but small reminders. Across north Tehran where the most luscious orchards once prospered, developers for decades now dry trees to turn their property into land for lucrative high-rises.
According to Tehran municipality law, an orchard cannot be built upon. So, they dry the trees and then request building permits. That is how the history of this city is wiped away: by burning the flesh of trees.
But in many street corners you will occasionally find an old home still in use. Usually, its an elderly couple with children abroad. Once the couple die, the house is sold by the heirs, and the tree drying ensues, followed by an apartment block.

A home in Pasdaran Street next to our high school was inhabited by an elderly couple with four children overseas. Once the couple passed away, it became a 15-storey apartment building. Each of the children made millions, a neighbour angrily remarks, dissatisfied with the heavy traffic the building has brought to the once idyllic corner.
In north Tehran, except for those few homes salvaged for museums, skyrocketing real-estate prices have left almost nothing intact. Adding to the confusion, are homes that were confiscated right after the revolution, taken over by various organisations, passed through the hands of one developer after the next, to the extent that past ownership is nearly untraceable. One might live in a high-rise that can cost as much as 70m tomans (14,000) per square metre, not knowing who used to sleep, sit or read on the very grounds upon which the tower was built.

One of north Tehrans most well-known homes, Baq-e Ferdows or the Mohammadieh palace, now serves as the citys cinema museum. The house was constructed in Shemiran, near Tajrish Square, in the mid-19th century, but underwent changes in ownership and architecture many times before the cultural ministry took the reins following the revolution.
Iranian scholar Mahmoud Afshar bought large areas of land around the orchard, and subsequently donated them for academic pursuits (like the Dehkohda language institute ) which stand to this day. Despite these random reminders, most of what stands of old Tehran must be sought after in downtown and southern areas of the city. The north has been mainly lost.
A rather well-maintained Qajar-era home in downtown Tehran is the house of Qavam ol-Saltaneh, prime minister under both the Qajar and Pahlavi monarchies. Qavams house is Abgineh, the glass and pottery museum, which stands on 7000 square metres of land. Wooden windows, long wooden stairways and delicate carvings adorn a building that served both as Qavams house and office. The museum space inside the house was designed by renowned Austrian architect Hans Hollein.
The care taken with Qavams house is in stark contrast to many other places, including another downtown Qajar-era home, Ettehadiyeh House . To the public, it is known as the home of Dayi-jan (dear uncle) in the popular television adaptation of Iraj Pezeshkzads novel My Uncle Napoleon . The historic house sits in ruins, decaying year after year, while Tehrans Beautification Organisation tries to battle developers who see it as prime real east for a mall. It is located in Lalehzar, in the heart of Tehrans financial district.

What can you expect of a city whose many custodians arent even from the city? said architect and urban planner Kamran Safamanesh in a ceremony to remember old Tehran. His remark hinted that many current-day functionaries rose to prominence with the revolution from villages across Iran , and have no understanding of cities, their histories and stories. A citys memories are a citys identity. Wipe them out and nothing remains, said Safamanesh.
Tehran is certainly not the first city to be overtaken by a development boom. In the last few years, gigantic shopping malls have only meant faster destruction: Palladium, the high-end mall recently opened in north Tehran, sits on grounds of an old orchard that was dried to make way for the mall, built with capital primarily invested by a kebab dynasty known as Raftari.
I remember the orchard, a resident says. Now our neighbourhood has become the parking lot of death. He is selling up and leaving, as the traffic has made it impossible for him to live here anymore, he said.
Although not as old as many others, one of Tehrans most disputed old homes is the house of Ostad (master) Behzad, the prominent 20th-century miniaturist. This is where some of the most well-known artists and intellectuals of the last century Tehran once gathered.

Behzads only son bequeathed the house to the Iranian Heritage Organisation in an agreement that would see the house become a museum. But once the papers were signed, the Heritage Organisation may have forgotten its end of the bargain. Today it serves as a library and storage space for the organisation  somewhere for sleepy, middle-aged ladies in office dress codes to sit around and drink tea with biscuits. The old tiles of the masters work have been removed, even the street upon which the house sits, once called Behzad, has for years now been changed to Nofallah.
The old homes of Tehran are not only reminders of this citys past art, but past co-existence. Haroon Yashayayi is a Jewish-Iranian writer who has spent the last few years writing on his beloved Oudlajan, the once predominantly Jewish neighbourhood near the bazaar.
Oudlajan, along with Sanglaj, Arg, Dowlat, Bazaar and Chaleh Meydan were the neighbourhoods that made Tehran-e Asr-e Nasseri, Tehran during the reign of Nasser al-Din Shah, as the dust was rising from a tired, sleepy city journeying to a new, unfamiliar world.
At the time, with nearly 3000 homes, Oudlajan was known as a prosperous place. Today, walking through the back alleyways you would not know this. The overhead domes have been refurbished but it remains deformed and alienated.
I remember when the street was thriving, when Molook Khanom, a local woman, would walk in the streets and wave hello to everybody, Yashayayi says, in a talk he gave on his upcoming book of stories of Oudlajan, to be published in Tehran. The neighbourhood is home to Tehrans oldest synagogues, sealed off to pedestrians, tourists and wanderers.
Home of prominent Zoroastrians also serve as reminders of the citys past: the house of Arbab Homroz, in east Tehran, was most recently launched as the Iranian National Museum of Graphic Arts. In central Tehrans Chahar Rah-e Valiasr (the intersection of Valiasr and Enqelab Street) a shining monument seems out of place: this is the Qajar-era home of Rostam Giv , the Zoroastrian parliament member and industrialist who also headed the Zoroastrian association until his death in 1980.
During the presidency of Mohammad Khatami, the house was bought by Jahad Daneshgahi, an educational organisation, and renovated by the Heritage Organisation. It is now a fully functional building that serves as classroom space.
Not all standing homes had the same fate. The home of Hassan Pirnia is one of the most significant architectural marvels of the Qajar era but sits in ruins , awaiting a shopping centre on some of its grounds. Some of the carvings at the home have been looted.
Pirnia was a lawmaker, historian and prime minister at the end of the Qajar era. This home is not simply a historic artefact . Within its walls, one of 20th century Irans most significant events took place: the writing of the constitution following the Constitutional Revolution of 1906.
These homes connect the memory of Tehran. Qavam did the writing, Pirnia provided the space. The constitution and the house both suffered the same fate: under rubble. A huge hole was dug for the mall - which has not been built - but permanently damaged the main building.
Emarat-e Masoodiyeh, Masoodiyeh palace, constructed on the orders of Zel-ol-Soltan, son of Nasser al-Din Shah, sits on five hectares of orchards. It has a remarkable facade with incredible carvings, disguising the fact it is crumbling from the inside.
Masoodiyeh palace in Tehran, Iran.
The house has garnered mainstream attention unlike any other in Tehran. In 2014, the Tehran autumn music festival was held there and most recently, the popular band Pallett held a ceremony to release their album on the palaces grounds with nearly 1,000 fans in attendance. They also have a song dedicated to Masoudiyeh in their new album: Tehran, Smile. None of this has quickened the pace of promised renovations inside the home, run jointly by Tehrans Beautification Organisation and the Heritage Organisation.
Tehrans Beautification Organisation, an agency that operates under the municipality, but with its own independent budget, walks on shaky ground. On paper, it is responsible for carrying out artistic projects around the city, and in conjunction with the Heritage Organisation, repairing and maintaining the citys monuments. While it employs sociologists, artists and architects who understand the worth of the citys old treasures, it is under the wings of a far larger body, the municipality, that is leading the charge for high-rises and shopping malls.
It often feels like we have to fight our own limbs, says an artist who works for the organisation. The municipality seems lost between the thirst for more and more real estate, which yields revenue, and the need to save what is left of the very things that give the city character. Some of Tehrans most notorious developers sit on the city council, only exacerbating this dilemma.
But so have we, the residents. Our very existence has mutated the shape and look of this city, from 15,000 residents in Qajar times to more than 8 million today. That the rats of Tehran are almost as big as cats not only speaks to the greed of developers, but how cities have come to be in the 21st century. Mass migration from villages and small towns to cities is the fuel driving ever more apartment buildings , more garbage , more waste, the very thirst for more.
A city without a memory may be a city lost. But what makes Tehrans story flit between the tragic and the uplifting is not just what has been lost but what has been salvaged, repaired, somehow maintained. Part of this citys story is this push and pull, this battle of opposing forces.
Tehran is a city with a past, and there are walls, homes and even people here to still remind you. If you look carefully, beyond the malls, and the butcher shops.

Protest over 18,600 minimum income rule to bring foreign spouses to UK
Immigration laws leave an estimated 33,000 people unable to remain with spouses in Britain as they do not earn enough to satisfy visa requirement

Ian Pineda-Andrews met his wife Jackie at the University of Edinburgh. It was meant to be: his father had met his mother at the same institution, and even his grandparents had met there.
But there was a problem. Jackie Pineda-Andrews is American. Under UK law the British spouse must have available funds equivalent to a minimum gross annual income of 18,600. As Ian was still a student, he was too poor to live in his home country with the woman he loved.
The couple are two of an estimated 33,000 people who have been told they cannot bring or remain with their spouses in Britain, because they do not earn enough money.
The government says the minimum income rule is to prevent unqualified spouses coming to the UK and becoming dependent on the state.
University is a time when people start falling in love, start finding themselves, said Mrs Pineda-Andrews. But its also the time, and in the years afterwards, when you are earning the least.
The rules were introduced on 9 July 2012, and every year dozens of couples who have been separated from their partners and children gather outside the Home Office to protest a law which means around 47% of Britons do not earn enough to fall in love with a foreigner.
Don Flynn, of Migrant Rights Network, which hosted the demo along with BritCits, an organisation for affected couples, said the British economy had suffered because of the law. The government claimed it would save 650m, but research from Middlesex University found that if, as expected, most of these spouses would have found employment, that would have made a contribution of over 850m.

There was a common thread among those who came to protest on Thursday, regardless of their background. All said that everyone they met thought the law was wrong.
I live in Ramsgate, the only Ukip council in the country. Ive spoken to everyone about it, from [people in] the pub to McDonalds. Everyone says it cant be right, said Tony Stevens, who came with his Gambian wife Isha. Marriage is precious. No government, no party has the right to deny me the right to be married to the woman of my choosing. Its shameful.
It has taken him and his wife two-and-a-half years and cost them 7,000 to go through the immigration process. I explained to the Home Office how Im a carer here, and I look after my mother who cannot walk. Here I can support us both and send money back to her family in Gambia, and everyone benefits, he said.
But were still told, why dont you go back and live there instead? Its immoral, ignorant and its class-based. And we still feel soon well have to fight all over again because the rules keep changing.
Among those protesting were family members with children living abroad, unable to return because of visa laws. My daughter is in Istanbul with her husband, said mother-of-two Janet Slack. She had all the benefits of an education here, health paid for by the taxpayer, and she has the experience and qualifications now. But she had never paid a penny back of her student loan, or in tax since moving to Turkey after university, because she cannot come back with her husband. Britain is losing out, and we have lost our daughter, and our other daughter has lost her only sibling.

Nigel Johnson brought his 11-year-old stepson Jeff to the protest from north Devon, with the youngster proudly wearing his British public school uniform. Nigels wife Burphan, Jeffs mother, is still in Bangkok.
We dont even intend to stay here long term, but weve scraped every penny together from the extended family to give this boy a proper British education. In just two years, with English as his second language, hes top of his class. But of course, he misses cuddles from his mum, Johnson said.
Ive cut grass, Ive cleaned holiday cottages, Ive worked six jobs to get my income over the threshold and still we are being turned down.
The legal fight against the law is now in its final throes. In 2013, the High Court found the threshold of 18,600 was too high, with Mr Justice Blake calling the law unjustified but it was overturned by the Court of Appeal and the case is now at the Supreme Court, due to sit this September. That same month will also see a report from childrens commissioner Anne Longfield examining the effects of the law on children separated from a parent.
But many of the couples at Thursdays protest who had successfully managed to settle in the UK said they had used a legal technicality known as the Surinder Singh route  after the landmark case.
It paved the way for Britons to work abroad in another European Economic Area country before bringing a non-European spouse to the UK, so EEA law on spouses, which is more generous, can take precedent.
That was the route taken by the Pineda-Andrews. With just a few weeks to go until his wifes visa expired and the pair would have to separate, Mr Pineda-Andrews took the radical decision to suspend his studies and move to Galway, Ireland for six months with his new wife.
It was a horrible, lonely time, Mr Pineda-Andrews said. I worked in the cafe in this small town where the economy meant all the other coffee shops in the entire town had closed down by the time we left. We had no money, and we couldnt afford to visit family, no one lived there who was our age. But it was worth it.
Mrs Pineda-Andrews said the system had coloured her view of Britain. I experienced so much bigotry, to be with the person I love. She smiled as she held up her passport, with the British visa inside. We are still fighting because we want change, I wouldnt wish this on my worst enemy. Well, maybe on Theresa May.

Whom the gods will destroy they first make bored. We have seen so many last chance eurozone summits about Greece that many Europeans have almost lost consciousness. We doze in the passenger seat even as the car goes over the cliff.
But this is it. If the EUs heads of government dont find a way forward at their emergency summit this Sunday , then on Monday a 70-year-old project of European integration may start to unravel. If you think its just the future of Greece thats at stake, think again.

The trouble is that the eurozones recurrent failure to do anything but kick the can down the road is not merely the result of flawed policies and weak leadership. There have been plenty of those, on all sides  including the Greek government, the German government, and European and international institutions. But the causes lie much deeper, in structural weaknesses of the European project that go back decades. Most of the politicians responsible for those weaknesses are dead or in their anecdotage. In many ways todays leaders are trapped in the dysfunctional logic of institutions that their predecessors created. It will take the most extraordinary leap of courage and imagination for them to escape it.
The two people most responsible for the eurozone crisis, of which Greece is just the most extreme manifestation, are the former French president Franois Mitterrand and long-time Italian prime minister Giulio Andreotti . Those two old foxes were the key players who, immediately after the fall of the Berlin Wall, pinned down Helmut Kohl, the West German chancellor, to a timetable for European monetary union in return for their own grudging support for German unification  but would not accept the fiscal union needed to make it work. Recent history, not only in Germany, said the historically informed statesman Kohl, teaches us that it is absurd to expect in the long run that you can maintain economic and monetary union without political union . How right he was.
This was only one of several original sins of the eurozone. While France and Italy demanded the commitment, Germany wrote most of the rules  and they were German rules, historically obsessed by countering inflation and crafted for the macroeconomic circumstances of a different time.
Because this was above all a political project, and France and Italy had to be in from the outset, there was a kind of reverse domino effect. If Italy had to be in, then surely Spain; if Spain, then surely Portugal  and so on all the way to Greece, a profoundly un-modernised, clientilist state, which should never have entered a monetary union that should itself not have been allowed to proceed  even within a smaller group of more compatible economies  until the original design flaws had been addressed.
Kohl hoped that, as so many times in post-1945 Europe , this economic integration would eventually catalyse the necessary political one. But so far it has not happened that way. As personal memories of war, occupation and dictatorship fade, national publics across the continent  not least Germanys itself  have become more pragmatic, sceptical or downright disillusioned about the European project.
The solution proposed for the EUs so-called democratic deficit  namely, to give more power to a directly elected European parliament, and then to have Spitzenkandidaten (lead candidates) for European commission president nominated by the main party groupings in that parliament  simply has not done the trick. In recent months I have asked audiences consisting mainly of people who actually voted in European parliament elections if they had consciously been voting for one of the Spitzenkandidaten. Hardly anybody says yes. Theory is one thing, practice another.
So whatever you think of the behaviour of Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, it is nonsense to pretend that Jean-Claude Juncker, the commission president, somehow enjoys a broader European democratic legitimacy in confronting him.
The reality of European democracy remains national, and behind that truth is an even deeper fact: there is hardly any more of a European public sphere today than there was when I started studying and travelling in Europe 40 years ago. There is a thin layer of publications, now online as well as in print, that reach a small, educated audience across the continent  the Guardian online is part of that layer  but most people in Europe still get the bulk of their news and views from national media  even when there is a shared language. In Vienna recently I was told how much the Austrian coverage of Greece differs in tone from that in Germany.
So there is not just one Greece, but 28 different ones , according to the country you are in. The Estonian and Latvian Greece would barely be recognisable to Italians, let alone Greeks. Equally, there is not just one Germany but 28: and few Germans would recognise their country in the Greek medias Germany.
These drastically contrasting narratives are fed by national politicians, who emerge from every Brussels summit to trumpet their own successes and blame any concessions on other governments and nasty European institutions. The Belgian foreign minister rather amusingly says he is the only one who cant blame it on Brussels.
The Belgian foreign minister says he is the only one who cant blame it on Brussels
Among a people without fellow-feeling, especially if they read and speak different languages, wrote John Stuart Mill , the united public opinion necessary to the working of representative government cannot exist. Europe has yet to prove him wrong. I have been in six European countries over the past six weeks, and the lack of fellow-feeling between them has been painful to observe.
Theres a cliche about democracy versus technocracy. Unfortunately the truth is even worse, for in the eurozone we have the worst of both worlds. Institutions such as the European commission and the IMF do have some of the flaws (as well as the virtues) of technocracy, including a tendency to stick to unrealistic, one-size-fits-all economic orthodoxies. But when it comes to European leaders, then it is a case of democracy versus democracy.
Immediately after last Sundays no vote in Greece , Tsipras celebrated the victory of democracy  Thermopylae replayed as agitprop. Yet, though Angela Merkel may not be directly descended from Pericles , she is every bit as much a democratic leader as Tsipras, and equally subject to the constraints of national interest and (often more important) national emotions.
So the 28 national leaders who gather in Brussels this Sunday, together with the heads of European institutions, will not merely have to leap over their own shadows. They will have to surmount giant structural obstacles that their predecessors created, go beyond the orthodoxies of technocracy and somehow negotiate a way to reconcile the legitimate imperatives of 28 different national democracies. If they fail, it wont be just Greece but the whole European project that will be plunged into still deeper crisis.
Will that existential crisis then finally be seized as kairos, the opportunity for decisive action? As a European, I hope it; as an analyst, I doubt it.

Wisconsin's strict 20-week abortion ban moves closer to becoming law

Related: Scott Walker set to revive abortion hard line on eve of presidential bid
The Wisconsin assembly passed the bill 61 to 34 after two hours of emotional testimony from lawmakers on both sides of the debate. The state senate had approved the legislation in June.
The bill now goes to Governor Scott Walker . Eager to burnish his conservative credentials ahead of his anticipated campaign for president, Walker specifically asked the legislature to send him the bill and has said repeatedly that he will sign it.
Wisconsin is the 15th state to pass a bill prohibiting abortion at 20 weeks or earlier. The bans are rooted in the belief that fetuses can feel pain at 20 weeks, a claim that has been disputed by the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
Opponents of the Wisconsin bill argued that the choice to seek an abortion should be between a woman and her doctor, and implored Republicans to stop interfering with womens reproductive rights.
During the floor debate, one Democratic representative accused Republicans of playing politics with womens rights in order to help Walker appeal to social conservatives in the 2016 Republican primaries.
Youre playing with womens uteruses for political reasons and the governor is the worst offender, said Terese Berceau.
Another Democrat read the text of one of Walkers 2014 campaign re-election ads, in which the governor appeared to obscure his anti-abortion views by softening his tone.
Theres no doubt in my mind the decision of whether or not to end a pregnancy is an agonizing one, said Dianne Hesselbein, quoting Walker. Thats why I support legislation to increase safety and to provide more information for a woman considering her options.
The bill leaves the final decision to a woman and her doctor.
Taking a different tack, Joe Sanfelippo, the Republican chairman of the assemblys health committee, argued that the state had an interest in protecting children from feeling pain.
He shared an anecdote about a woman whose doctor told her that her baby would die if she attempted to deliver him alive. Despite the doctors warning, she decided to go through with the delivery and now is the mother of a healthy 11-year-old, Sanfelippo said.
Medicine isnt black and white, he said. Doctors cannot always say for sure what is going to happen in any situation.
The laws challenge the fetal viability standard on abortions established by the 1973 US supreme court decision Roe v Wade, which legalized abortions. Fetal viability is generally believed to occur between 22 and 24 weeks.
Legislatures in 14 other states have passed a version of the 20-week ban, though the laws in Georgia, Idaho and Arizona have been struck down by courts. Litigation is ongoing in other states. The Wisconsin bill is likely to face a legal challenge if Walker signs it into law.
Under the Wisconsin bill, doctors and medical professionals who perform abortions could face criminal charges, punishable by $10,000 in fines or three-and-a-half years in prison. The legislation also allows fathers to sue doctors for damages.
The bill carves out exemptions for medical emergencies, in cases in which women may die or suffer permanent injury within 24 hours.

ASX 200 companies that dont appoint women to their board of directors could face reactionary voting from superannuation investors, a peak body has warned.
There are 32 ASX 200 companies that still have no female directors, and many still that only have one, and the Australian council of superannuation investors (Acsi) has written to the chairs urging them to make real progress towards a 30% female representation target.
In March research revealed there are more men named Peter who are chief executive or chair of an ASX200 company than there are women.
The 32 companies named by Acsi on Friday include Seven Group Holdings, Australian Agricultural Co. Ltd, CabCharge Australia, and GUD Holdings  the owner of household brands including Sunbeam.

We want companies to understand that really were serious about this issue and its time for change, Louise Davidson, Acsi CEO told Guardian Australia.
Weve been talking about this issue with companies and publicly for four or five years but now weve set concrete targets ourselves, whereby we are looking for boards to have appointed 30% women by 2017.
While Acsis initial action was to continue engaging with companies to reach that goal, Fridays announcement also served to put companies on notice that without concrete action Acsi will be thinking about the way we advise members about their proxy voting strategies, said Davidson.
Acsi members count between 10 and 15% of most listed company shares in the ASX200. So theres a potential for there to be a pretty significant vote against one or more directors if that comes to pass. Im hopeful we wont have to do that. It would be much better to have boards arrive at this spot of their own accord.

The only female board member of Seven Group, Dulcie Boling, retired as a director last November, and a spokesman told Guardian Australia the board is committed to the appointment of a female director as part of its current succession process which is underway to fill the vacancy on the board created by the recent retirement of Don Voelte.
The spokesman also pointed to the recent announcements of Seven West Media, of which Seven Group is a major shareholder, in appointing Sheila McGregor to the board as its second woman alongside Michelle Deaker.
The spokesman declined to comment on whether there were dedicated targets to increase the numbers further on either board.
Cabcharge submitted a gender equality annual report, but listed many relevant policies as contained within another strategy and did not give further detail.
In a statement to Guardian Australia Cabcharge managing director Andrew Skelton said the company actively consider diversity as one of the important selection criteria for new members when board vacancies arise.
Our focus is to assemble and develop a team of people with the right skills and knowledge to ensure that we can rise to the challenges facing our business. In 2015 we have been pleased to see some clear advancements in line with this, with two of our most recent senior appointments being women: our new chief financial officer and head of marketing, Skelton said.
Additionally, at Cabcharge we have a number of informal processes in place for fostering diversity, including flexible working arrangements for employees.

GUD Holdings, owner of consumer and industrial companies including Sunbeam, had  at the time of its 2014 annual report  a 30% female workforce overall, but no female non-executive directors.
It listed as an objective to endeavour to have a number of female members on the Board that is in proportion to the female members represented in the workforce of GUD Holdings Limited, but in any event not less than one female member.
However this status was described as remaining a longer-term objective.
Davidson said Acsi was looking for more concrete goals and some commitments around timing and quantum.
One female board member in a company was a start which should not be discounted, said Davidson, but in our view appointing one women is not getting the job done.

The research is pretty clear its a lot more effective when you have two or more women on the board, she said.
Davidson pointed to a recent Credit Suisse report, the CS Gender 3000: Women in Senior Management , which found that greater diversity in boards and management are empirically associated with higher returns on equity, higher price/book valuations and superior stock price performance.
According to Acsi, one third of S&amp;P/ASX 200 companies are in the two lowest categories of its annual review of sustainability disclosure.

Republicans ignore Puerto Rico's debt crisis at own peril, says former governor
Luis Fortuo notes that Puerto Ricans are a key voting bloc in Florida, a swing state whose outsize expat population is heavily influenced by news back home

Related: Puerto Rico's 'unpayable' debt: is this the Greece of the western hemisphere?
In an interview with the Guardian, Fortuo said the candidates who are serious about pursuing the partys nomination to the end will have to comment on the debt crisis there.
Fortuo, a well-respected Republican who was mooted as a potential vice-presidential pick for Mitt Romney in 2012, said the issue could be important not just in the general election but in the 2016 Republican presidential primary as well.
Florida has long been a crucial swing state, and Puerto Ricans make up a key demographic in that state. Concentrated in the I-4 corridor, a key battleground in general elections, the nearly 1 million Floridians of Puerto Rican descent can determine who wins the states 29 electoral votes.
As Fortuo pointed out, Puerto Rican American voters backed George W Bush for president in 2004 and Marco Rubio for Senate in 2010, but also backed Barack Obama in both 2008 and 2012. Fortuo also noted that while Puerto Ricans are a crucial general election demographic, their votes loom even larger in the 2016 GOP primary.
Floridas presidential primary is scheduled to be held on 15 March and is a winner-take-all contest. The Sunshine State allocates 99 delegates of the 1,235 needed to clinch the Republican nomination.
However, thats not the only Republican primary that week in which Puerto Rican voters play a key role. Just two days before, Puerto Rico itself holds a Republican primary where any candidate who receives 50% of the vote gets all 23 delegates up for grabs. Not only that, with Floridas Puerto Rican population and proximity to the island, any win in Puerto Rico is bound to get significant attention in the Sunshine State, creating the potential for a Republican contender to land a one-two punch.
Related: Economic exodus means two-thirds of Puerto Ricans may soon live in states
This could favor Jeb Bush. While both he and Marco Rubio are from Florida, Bush also has close ties to Puerto Rico. As Fortuo, a Bush supporter, pointed out, the former Florida governor spent three months campaigning for his father in Puerto Rico during the 1980 Republican presidential primary, and both George HW Bush and George W Bush had looked out for the islands interests while in the White House. Fortuo particularly praised the elder Bush, whom he said had a soft spot in his heart for Puerto Rico and showed it over and over.
The question is whether the ongoing crisis on the island will become a political issue. In Fortuos opinion, it could. The former Puerto Rican governor noted that the commonwealth could take two different pathways in resolving the crisis which was sparked when the commonwealths governor Alejandro Garca Padilla proclaimed nearly two weeks that the islands debts were unpayable. (Although the longtime United States territory had long been struggling economically, the statement of Garca Padilla, who narrowly bested Fortuo in the islands 2012 gubernatorial election, focused national attention on its travails.)
The first is to take what he viewed as a far more responsible tack in dealing with the debt crisis, and make clear that holders of Puerto Ricos general obligation bonds and Cofina bonds, which are backed by sales tax, would be fully protected. The second entails politicians continuing along the current path, and things will get worse and lawyers will just get rich.
If the second path is pursued, it could have grave consequences and create a mounting political crisis. In particular, with 50,000 Puerto Ricans leaving the island every year  many of them with families still there  the issue could become far more important, especially with various Puerto Rican agencies due to make major payments to bondholders in the coming months.
Puerto Rican bonds are widely held, as they have long been considered a safe investment. Many people are holding Puerto Rico bonds in mutual funds, IRA accounts and other retirement accounts and they dont even know it, Fortuo said gravely. It wont be a crisis until enough people come to realize that it is affecting them personally.
Rick Wilson, a top Florida Republican consultant, was somewhat more skeptical of the impact of the debt crisis on Puerto Rican American voters in Florida. In his opinion, the issues in Puerto Rico have not yet penetrated outside [the] immediate community and a lot of them feel a little more insulated because of the Sunshine States booming economy. Wilson went on to note that while a lot was in flux on the topic, it was still a secondary issue.
One of the big issues in Puerto Ricos crisis is that unlike with American states, Chapter 9 of the bankruptcy code doesnt apply to the commonwealth. The provision allows any municipality, which is defined as a political subdivision or public agency or instrumentality of a State, to reorganize its debts. This includes cities, counties as well as a variety of public agencies and authorities. However, Puerto Rico is not a state.
Related: Colony, state or independence: Puerto Rico's status anxiety adds to debt crisis
Among Republicans, Jeb Bush came out in favor of applying Chapter 9 to Puerto Rico during an April visit to the island, saying: I think that Puerto Rico ought to be treated as other states are treated as it relates to restructuring. All three major Democratic candidates  Hillary Clinton, Martin OMalley and Bernie Sanders  have supported this as well.
In contrast, Marco Rubio has been far more equivocal on the subject. When asked by the Guardian on Wednesday whether he supported legislation to allow Puerto Rican municipalities to file for Chapter 9 bankruptcy, the Florida Republican called it a complex issue. He added: We want to make sure that whatever decision we make with regards to this is probably going to create a precedent for other jurisdictions in the country that are going to face similar situations in the near future. However, Chapter 9 already applies in all 50 states and has recently been invoked in financial crises in major cities such as Detroit and Stockton, California.
Yet even if Puerto Rico dodges this bullet, its ambiguous status will remain an issue. As a commonwealth, Puerto Ricans have long enjoyed American citizenship without the burden of paying federal income tax. However, that also means they dont vote in the general election, and their government doesnt have the same sovereign authority as state governments.
Fortuo, a longtime supporter of Puerto Rican statehood , thought the debt crisis made clear the need for his native island to be a full-fledged state. Not only does the former governor believe an increasing number of people on Puerto Rico are realizing the disadvantage that it is to be territory as oppose to a state, he added that he doesnt believe the founding fathers intended a territory to remain a territory for 120 years.
However, the debate over statehood remains unresolved. While a majority of Puerto Ricans supported statehood in a 2012 referendum, the vote was nonbinding and Congress has yet to act. While Jeb Bush favors Puerto Rican statehood, Rubio said Wednesday that he would like a second vote on the topic. He told the Guardian that the 2012 referendum lacked clarity because it had three options, and that there needs to be an up-or-down referendum. In 2012, Republican nominee Mitt Romney supported statehood for the island.
Democrats are even more muddled on the topic. For example, while the campaign of former Maryland governor Martin OMalley has repeatedly touted his leadership on Puerto Rico, they have not responded to numerous requests from the Guardian about OMalleys position on statehood.
In the meantime, a bill to apply Chapter 9 to Puerto Rico was introduced in Congress by the commonwealths delegate to the House of Representatives in February. It has yet to receive a vote.

Kerry has been under pressure to present a deal to Congress by Thursday at midnight, so American lawmakers would have 30 days to debate it in Congress. If the accord comes later, then under a new law there will be a 60-day review period.
If the accord comes later, it goes beyond the cut-off date established by US lawmakers to ensure they were able to review without disrupting their August recess.
As the Guardians Washington Bureau chief Dan Roberts wrote earlier this week:
The White House remains confident it can persuade enough lawmakers to back what its negotiators come up with regardless of the length of the review period, but the added time is prompting both opponents and supporters of the deal to step up their lobbying efforts in anticipation of intense debate in Washington over whether it does enough to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.
We expect millions of dollars will be spent on both sides of this issue and are now girded for a more extended fight: we are ready for that, said Dylan Williams, vice president of government affairs at J-Street, a liberal US group that backs the outline deal.
I think the extended review period will not have an impact on public support and congressional support for a deal, but it certainly provides more time for opponents of the deal to try to peel away congressional support, he told the Guardian.

A Spanish hospital where a British woman claimed she was separated from her newborn daughter after doctors expressed doubts she was the mother followed protocol in the best interests of the baby, it has been claimed.
Stacie Cottle, a 27-year-old dental nurse from London, is considering taking legal action against the Comarcal de la Axarqua hospital near Malaga. Cottle claims she was only allowed limited, supervised contact with her daughter, Anzelika, for three weeks pending DNA results to prove that she was the mother.

Cottle, of British Caribbean origin, has said she feared her treatment was influenced by race after she went into early labour at 36 weeks, giving birth in her mothers new flat in a village about 30 miles from Malaga.
But a spokesman for the Andalusia regional health authority said Cottles behaviour when she presented at the hospital with the baby two days after the birth had raised concerns about the childs welfare. The doctor who attended to her started to ask her questions, about when she gave birth and other questions in the established protocol for when a person doesnt give birth in a public hospital, he said.
The woman left the building with the baby after being told by a doctor that she and the newborn would have to kept in the hospital, he said. In line with protocol, the doctor then called the police to tell them there was a newborn and the woman had left hospital. The priority of health authorities is the protection and the health of the child. This was a child that still had the umbilical cord attached.
Asked if doctors were worried about the health of the child, or about whether this was the childs mother, the spokesman replied: It was both. There was a health risk because it was a newborn baby. And, given the reaction of the woman, the professional called the national police, who brought the case to the judicial authorities. Police returned Cottle and the baby to hospital pending the DNA tests.
Cottle has claimed that the doctors maintained their scepticism even after an examination showed that she had recently given birth. She said she stayed in the maternity ward while Anzelika was held in the neonatal unit, and that she was allowed only limited  and supervised  access to her infant for feeding. Her older daughter, Annabella, had to be looked after by her mother.
The DNA results, proving she was the mother, arrived on Tuesday, three weeks after the birth on 16 June. Only then was she allowed to claim her new daughter from the neonatal ward.
The spokesman said the restrictions on Cottle seeing her daughter in hospital were because of schedules, which had been ordered by the judge who also ordered the DNA test. The DNA test results came back to us on 7 July. Then we had to wait for the judicial order, which established the maternal relation and archived the case. Immediately the hospital proceeded to release the newborn baby with her birth certificate and with her schedule of follow-up appointments for her family doctor as is normal.
We dont know this woman, or if shes here or not, or if shes going to her country or not. But as it is a newborn born in Spain and in Malaga, were responsible for giving her a series of follow-up appointments so the baby is taken care of. All we did was follow a protocol that we have, in which the priority is the protection and assistance of that minor, in this case a newborn baby.
This newborn was taken from the hospital by the mother. As soon as that happened, we couldnt be sure that the baby was being cared for. I dont know how it works in England, if its very common to have babies at home and come to the hospital so that they can be registered. But we have to confirm that she is the mother.
And on top of it, her reaction was to leave the hospital. It wasnt a very normal reaction. She should have stayed at the hospital with her baby.
Asked if there were worries that Cottle had stolen the baby, or that the child was trafficked, the spokesman said: I dont know. The only thing I can tell you is that in the face of the reaction of the woman to leave the hospital, the personnel activated the protocol. It was a newborn with its umbilical cord on the streets. The situation wasnt very normal.
Cottle has said she had received no apology from the hospital and that the situation was never satisfactorily explained to her. She has told the Guardian: Repeatedly, during my stay in the hospital, I was called a criminal by staff and patients, from the day we were admitted to practically the day we left. She now plans to return to London with both her daughters as soon as possible.
Cottle has said she believes race might have played a part in the hospitals actions, and told the Guardian: One of the doctors said she believed I may have been from Kenya or Senegal. I have no proof race was involved, but I heard that from a doctor. It made no sense, because by this time theyd taken photocopies of my British passport.

Descendents of Joseph Goebbels, Adolph Hitlers propaganda minister, are to be paid royalties for extracts from his diaries published in a new biography, following a bitter legal battle.
The publishers of the biography, Random House Germany, had resisted demands to pay Goebbels estate , arguing that copyright laws should be overturned on moral grounds.
But the Munich district court ruled against the publisher on Thursday, although it said the rights to Goebbels literary estate expire at the end of 2015 and similar cases are not expected to any significant extent in the future.
Cordula Schacht  a lawyer whose father, Hjalmar Schacht, was Hitlers minister of economics  represented the Goebbels estate in taking legal action against Random House Germany and its imprint Siedler.
The family of Goebbels, who was one of the architects of the Final Solution, argued that they should be paid for extracts from his diaries which are published in the biography by Peter Longerich, a professor of modern German history at Royal Holloway, University of London .
Rainer Dresen, the general counsel of Random House Germany , said Schacht had rejected his offer  made privately and in court  for royalties to be paid if they were donated to a Holocaust charity. Schacht insisted that money should go to Goebbels family, thought to include descendants of his siblings.
Dresen spoke on Thursday of his shock at the courts verdict, describing it as a sad day for Germany.
He noted the irony of the courts setting in Munich, where Hitler and the Nazis rose to prominence. Dresen said: You have a strange feeling. Youre crossing those buildings, buildings where  Hitler was  on the balcony. That of course is not a legal thing. Its a moral issue.
Dresen said the insensitivity of the verdict was an extension of the defence used by Nazi war criminals  that they were just following orders. He added: They have no feeling for the meaning above the legal questions  I was shocked by the [courts] lack of historical interest They took the easy road.
This way, he observed, they can go on ignoring the fundamental question: should money go to the estate of a war criminal?
The work, which makes extensive use of the diaries, was published in Germany in 2010. The English edition was published by Penguin Random House UK and its imprint Bodley Head in May.
Goebbels remained with Hitler in their besieged bunker in Berlin. He and his wife took their own lives after poisoning their six children. His diaries span 1924 to 1945. Copies of them are in public libraries.
Last September, the Munich district court ordered Random House Germany to disclose its earnings, but the publisher appealed on legal, copyright and moral grounds. The case was heard in April.
Dresen said the court was not interested in the moral question even for one second. He described the verdict as elegant but without morality.
The publisher now intends to appeal through the German supreme court.

Indias highest court has ordered the nations most powerful investigation agency to investigate a massive college admission and government job recruitment scandal linked to dozens of suspicious deaths.
In the latest twist to a story that has gripped the nation, its supreme court on Thursday ordered the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to take over the inquiry into the so-called Vyapam scandal in the central state of Madhya Pradesh. Dozens of senior officials have been jailed, nearly 2,000 people arrested and the scandal has been linked to dozens of suspicious deaths.
The minister dismissed the charge that whistle-blowers were being targeted to shield top politicians and bureaucrats
In the past two weeks, a key witness died of a heart attack in prison ; an investigative journalist probing the scam was found dead; and the body of a medical college dean whose institution was being investigated was recovered from a hotel in Delhi.
Thousands of people now working as teachers, nurses, doctors, vets and police officers are believed to have paid middlemen to arrange high marks at crucial examinations.
The accused in the case include senior police officers, local politicians, former ministers and top officials who are alleged to have rigged eligibility tests for admission to medical colleges and recruitment for coveted jobs in the police force, schools and banking sector. Police have also arrested hundreds of parents and students for paying bribes.

Local media have described the scandal as without parallel and one of the most blatant and extensive rigging exercises of its kind ever uncovered in India.
The supreme court also directed the central Indian government to respond to a request for the removal of Ram Naresh Yadav, the federally appointed governor of Madhya Pradesh, after questions were raised about his involvement. Yadavs 50-year-old son died mysteriously in March after being accused of accepting bribes.
The state is run by Indias ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), which won power in a landslide election 14 months ago. One reason for the BJPs crushing victory was the series of scandals that had tainted the incumbent Congress party.
The Vyapam scandal, named after the local language acronym for the examining board where much of the corruption appears to have been concentrated, is the first such affair to hit the BJP.
At least 600 people are still being sought by police for interview in connection with the scandal
Congress leaders had been demanding the involvement of the CBI and accused the Madhya Pradesh government of trying to influence the outcome of the inquiry by the state police.
Digvijay Singh, a Congress leader, demanded the resignation of Madhya Pradeshs chief minister, the BJPs Shivraj Singh Chouhan, on Thursday.
Students who were made to believe that money was the only way to get admission to higher education in the state are behind bars, while those who took the bribes are roaming free, Singh told reporters .
Chouhan, who has said the mission of my life is that the entire truth in this case should come out, initially resisted the CBI investigation.
At least 600 people are still being sought by police for interview in connection with the scandal.
Much of the media attention has focused on the deaths of witnesses and accused. Many of the dead are relatively young and autopsy reports in most cases have been inconclusive.
Babulal Gaur, home minister in Madhya Pradesh, dismissed the oppositions charge that witnesses and whistleblowers were being targeted to shield top politicians and bureaucrats. He said most of the deaths were due to natural causes.
The scam dates to 2007, but investigations only began in July 2013 following the arrest of 20 people during a medical school entrance test.
Investigations revealed a range of different ways of cheating. One of the most straightforward involved gifted students being paid to impersonate wealthy but poor-performing candidates. Another tactic involved submitting blank papers which would be accepted by examiners and then filled in later. Middlemen charged substantial fees, equivalent to many years salary, for serving government doctors or police officials.

Experts say that such corruption sets up a vicious circle as officials who have paid to obtain their posts seek to maximise the return on their investments through graft.
There is ferocious competition in India for a limited number of government jobs, which often come with accommodation allowances and pensions, as well as for places in establishments offering specialist training. Weak oversight and a culture of bribery has undermined many professional institutions in the south Asian power.
Protection of whistleblowers is also a problem. In a report issued earlier this week, activists said 39 people who had used Indias Right to Information Act in the decade since it was passed have been killed as a result of their inquiries.

Prosecutors in Beijing decided not to bring charges against Zhang Miao, who was a news assistant for Die Zeit , said lawyer Zhou Shifeng.
Zhou said Zhang was scheduled to be released on Thursday night after being detained in October on a disturbance charge.
Her detention highlights the precarious situation for Chinese nationals working for foreign media, as they often become targets of police harassment and intimidation.
Angela Kckritz, the Beijing correspondent for Die Zeit, left China after she also felt pressure from authorities following Zhangs detention.
Zhou said he had argued to prosecutors that the evidence against his client was obtained through coercion and torture and should be considered illegal. We had expected her release because we believed the evidence was invalid and could not be used, he said.
Kckritz and Die Zeit could not be immediately reached for comment.

The councillor behind a French campaign to stamp out food waste has called on the head of the European commission and national leaders to adopt laws forcing supermarkets to give their unsold produce to charities.
Arash Derambarsh was in fighting mood on Thursday after the European parliament adopted a resolution inviting the EC to encourage the creation of agreements between supermarkets and organisations helping the poor and hungry.
The ball is now in the court of the commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, and European leaders. They have a responsibility before history and before the 500 million people of Europe, Derambarsh said after the vote.
I now say directly to all of them, its now up to you. Do this, and do this before the end of the year.
Related: Campaign to cut supermarket food waste reaches European parliament
In May Derambarsh succeeded in persuading the French government to pass a law forcing supermarkets to donate products approaching their sell-by date to charities.
Until now, some shops have been destroying unsold food with bleach. Under the new French law , supermarkets with a floor space of more than 400 sq m will face fines of up to 75,000 if they are caught throwing away or destroying unsold food fit for consumption.
On Thursday, MEPs at Strasbourg adopted a resolution on the circular economy into which the food waste amendment had been tabled at the last minute.
The MEP Anglique Delahaye, who introduced the amendment, said after the vote: Its the first step in the fight against food waste in Europe.

The EU wastes 89m tonnes of food a year, while an estimated 1.3bn tonnes are wasted worldwide annually.
A petition launched in seven European countries including Britain calling for support for legislation has more than 540,000 signatures.
Derambarsh, a municipal councillor for Courbevoie, north-west of Paris, and a member of Nicolas Sarkozys centre-right Republicans party, now aims to have the issue tabled at the United Nations later this year.
We cannot sit back and do nothing while people in Greece, Portugal, Spain, Italy and elsewhere are going hungry. We cannot continue to ignore this, he said.

        <title>Greek crisis: Twitter actively shapes fast-moving events</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/09/greek-crisis-twitter-social-media</Link>

There have been numerous memorable moments from Greeces rollercoaster debt crisis. Think jubilant protesters celebrating Sundays no vote in Athens , or Yanis Varoufakis, departing from political office on his Yamaha motorbike.
But it is perhaps Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission chief, who best encapsulates the way in which social media has defined the current crisis, creating both opportunities and pitfalls for politicians, and a source of vivid, unmediated real-time information for everyone else.
On Tuesday Juncker told parliament in Strasbourg that he opposed Grexit. A group of MEPs, some of them from Ukip, then spotted that Juncker was engrossed in his phone , rather than listening to the debate. They began heckling him.
Speaking in French, an irritated Juncker told them he was busy swapping messages with Alexis Tsipras . Stop all this chatter about me looking at my telephone all the time. I am texting, as they say in Franglais, with the Greek prime minister, he said defiantly, adding: Im doing my work. 
Meanwhile, Matteo Renzi, the Italian prime minister, used Facebook to post his latest thoughts on how the debt crisis might be resolved. He told his 800,000 Facebook followers that Europe was finished unless it stopped being the prisoner of rules and bureaucracy and acted in the spirit of solidarity.
In crises gone by, European leaders were able to negotiate in secret. Their decisions were revealed afterwards, via leaks, briefings or wordy press releases. Further back, during the economic crises of the 1970s, for example, what really went on only become known years later when those involved, like Tony Benn, penned their memoirs.
The current Greek crisis, by contrast, has played out minute by minute, tweet by tweet, across Twitter, Facebook and newspaper live blogs . Twitter hasnt merely reflected fast-moving events: it has actively shaped them. Some of the EUs protagonists have revealed policy positions on Twitter ; traders have moved markets on the (sometimes unsubstantiated) basis of 140 characters.
 Linas Linkevicius (@LinkeviciusL) July 5, 2015
Difficult to help #Greece against the will of people &amp; Government which lives in parallel World
Above all it is the Greek government  in the shape of iconoclastic now ex-finance minister Varoufakis and prime minister Tsipras  who have used social media to grab the initiative. This has been in sharp contrast to their biggest critics in Europe - the non-tweeting German duo of Angela Merkel and Wolfgang Schuble .
Before his resignation on Monday, Varoufakis was a hyperactive tweeter. He posted links to his interviews (with Channel 4s Paul Mason , among others) and flagged articles supportive of the no cause (such as Joseph Stiglitzs in the Guardian ). His blog post on Monday announcing his exit  Minister No More  attracted 18,000 retweets. It includes the classic Varoufakisian line: I shall wear the creditors loathing with pride.
Tsipras has tweeted regularly in Greek to his quarter of a million followers. He also has an English account . His style is less flamboyant than Varoufakiss but has its own gnomic charm. On Monday, after his referendum triumph, he tweeted:  Democracy and right is on our side. I am sure that we will succeed . Before the poll he noted that the Greeks were fighting  with a weapon more potent than any other - right .
Compare this with Germanys vice-chancellor Sigmar Gabriel, Merkels coalition partner, who shared his views by giving a traditional interview to the German weekly Stern. The entry of Greece into the euro was done, from todays perspective, very naively, he told the magazine. Gabriel last tweeted in 2013.
 Sigmar Gabriel (@sigmargabriel) October 29, 2013
Aufgrund massiver technischer Probleme mussten wir den fr heute angekndigten Chat abbrechen. Wir holen ihn so schnell wie mglich nach.
According to Sony Kapoor , the director of the international thinktank Re-Define , Twitter has become invaluable for Greek crisis-watchers. Its the most efficient source of relevant information. You have a curated version of all other sources of news. We used to send out email press releases. Now we just tweet them.
Kapoor agrees that the Greek leadership has been far more adroit at exploiting new media than its more traditional German counterparts. This has something to do with German political culture. It moves slowly. Its more consensus-orientated. Its less individualistic  There is a general scepticism about social media [in Germany], linking to issues of privacy.
Kapoor is one of a number of commentators  some world-famous academics, others independent bloggers  who have coalesced into a virtual community. They follow every twist and turn of the crisis, and offer their own insight, driving the news agenda, and writing in colourful terms. This is the first crisis in the social media age. Twitter in particular has arrived, Kapoor says.
There is no longer a barrier between distinguished economists, previously in ivory towers, and ordinary citizens simply interested in events going in Athens. Regular crisis tweeters include the Nobel laureate and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman , Nobel prizewinner Stiglitz , and labour economist Danny Blanchflower . All three are based in the US; social media makes distance irrelevant.
Other notable pundits include the anonymous Zero Hedge , commentators Lorcan Roche Kelly and Fabrizio Goria , Theodora Oikonomides, who blogs as Irate Greek , and the Greek journalist Efthimia Efthimiou . Their followers are in the tens of thousands; collectively they provide lively and continuous micro-journalism. To an extent, they also make old-fashioned print outlets  tomorrows newspaper  redundant.
Oligarchs control much of the Greek press. According to Oikonomides, frustrated Greek citizens turned to social media from 2011, when the countrys debt crisis first began. Some politicians in turn started tweeting, including far-right ones. There are more progressive people active on Twitter, Oikonomides says, adding that Varoufakis had a large following well before he became a celebrity minister.
Before Sundays referendum the no campaign employed social media on a massive scale to connect with voters. Oikonomides says that she wasnt convinced this online surge corresponded with popular opinion  until the result came in. I never expected 61.5%, she says.
At times, the intra-pundit conversation on Greece has become heated, even angry. On Wednesday, Mason issued a semi-apology following a tremendous Twitter spat with @Greekanalyst , an anonymous blogger. Mason accused Greekanalyst of trolling him, and suggested he was part of a unaccountable rightwing network. He and other abusive individuals were revelling in their own countrys destruction, Mason wrote.
 Paul Mason (@paulmasonnews) July 7, 2015
@GreekAnalyst which side your grandfather fight on in WW2? Oh I forgot you don't exist
Perhaps unwisely, Mason had tweeted: Which side your grandfather fight on in WW2? Oh I forgot you dont exist. Justifying his actions, Mason said hed been on the receiving end of weeks of vitriol, online and off, including from two Greek businessmen who verbally abused me in a hotel lobby and blocked his way.
He blogged: For the best part of four weeks people on both the right and left of Greek internet have been abusing me, aiming vile abuse against myself, friends and anybody associated with me in Greece. I know other senior journalists that this is happening to, from all sides ... I understand there is rage on all sides in Greece today, and in future I will learn not to feed the trolls.
Spare a thought, meanwhile, for Euclid Tsakalotos, Greeces new finance minister, who turned up at his first Eurogroup meeting in Brussels with his notes clearly visible . Within seconds Tsakalotoss handwritten talking points  including the chastening remark no triumphalism  had been flashed round the world.
Its made policymaking a lot more difficult, Kapoor says of Twitter. It increases volatility. There can be a crowd mentality. Leaks are easier. But its also been a force for democratisation in terms of citizens and actively engaged stakeholders.
He acknowledges that some key European institutions like the European Central Bank and the European commission have belatedly responded by improving their media operations. On Monday Kapoor tweeted his own prediction for what would happen next: If someone were to put a gun to my head to force me to choose now - Id still say #Grexit unlikely.

Half a continent away from Athens, Milda is unimpressed. Watching reports of the Greek predicament on the news, the Latvian pensioner has little sympathy for her counterparts 1,800 miles to the south.
Cant they get by on 120 a week? she asks, referring to the latest cash limits on pensioners introduced in Greece. Lifes less expensive down there. Its warmer, they dont have to pay for heating or winter boots, and fruit and vegetables must be cheaper.
Anyway, if they borrowed all that money, they should pay it back, thats the way I see it.
Europes great Greek crisis is often cast as the downtrodden Hellenic heroes versus the ubermasters of austerity in Berlin. In reality, however, it is smaller nations that have faced crisis themselves, swallowed the austerity medicine and lived to tell the tale who are most hostile to another bailout for Athens.
From central European minnows such as Slovakia to Baltic eurozone republics such as Latvia and Lithuania , hard-pressed pensioners and workers earning barely 500 a month are at a loss as to why Greece should qualify for more largesse.
Mildas monthly pension is 293 a month , well under half the current level in Greece . When Latvia went through a similar debt crisis in 2009, it imposed swingeing budget cuts and tax increases worth about 15% of GDP over three years. Output fell by a quarter and unemployment soared to more than 20%. The population fell as people left in droves.
GDP - Greece, Latvia and Lithuania
These measures were hugely controversial at the time, and many people thought they would lead to catastrophe. The US economist Paul Krugman predicted at the end of 2008: Latvia is the new Argentina.
By the second half of 2010, however, the economy had started to grow again, and from 2011 to 2013 Latvia was among the fastest growing countries in the EU. Despite the fact that the currency was not devalued, exports are now at record highs, some 60% above where they were before the crisis.
Related: Unsustainable futures? The Greek pensions dilemma explained
So in Latvia there is a widespread view: If we did it, why cant the Greeks? The countrys finance minister, Jnis Reirs, said recently that the Latvian people dont understand the Greek people. Milda exemplifies that.
In next-door Lithuania, politicians are also struggle to tell their electorate why a country that tightened its belt should now pay for one that will not. Lithuanias president, Dalia Grybauskait, has been one of the most outspoken opponents at EU summits of doling out more cash to Greece .
The average monthly pension in Lithuania is 242.10 before tax, compared with 700 in Greece. The average wage in Lithuania is 699.80 before tax and 543.60 after, again way below the Greek average.
Average unemployment benefits come in at about 175. Such figures illustrate why the Lithuanian people have little sympathy for the Greeks.
Greek pensions
Rimantas adius, the Lithuanian finance minister, said further support for Greece would not be a popular decision in the Baltic state. We wouldn not receive an enthusiastic support, especially if we ask for the public opinion, he said.
We express solidarity even if financial aid is needed by a wealthier or more economically developed eurozone country, he said. We agree to take part in the aids mechanisms, since financial stability in the eurozone is a common benefit we should all preserve.
However, we strictly emphasise that solidarity cannot be a one-way relationship. I mean that the country willing to receive our help must be ready to comply with its obligations, fully and in time.
Greece is at a crossroads. One path, to be honest, leads to an economical abyss. The other one is much more complicated, but it does present a possibility to solve the current economical problems while remaining in the eurozone. With the eurozones assistance, of course, adius said.
Some Lithuanian politicians worry that the current crisis might send Greece into Russias sphere of influence , but adius said such concerns were premature.
Theoretically, one can discuss such questions, though its more of a topic for political scientists. So far, at least in the discussions of the ministers of finance, Greece hasnt played this card once, he said.
No country is homogenous, and there are people in the Baltic states who feel Greeces pain. Ignatas Gotautas, a young middle-class man, said that although Greek wages and benefits were way above Lithuanian levels, recent cuts in Greece had taken their toll.
We should contribute somewhat, in solidarity, but the Greeks shouldnt be so arrogant about it, Gotautas said. They suffered cuts from a higher level, and these cuts had to be painful. Its hard to help someone when youre not in a good situation yourself, but some solidarity should be maintained by the EU.
Valentinas Mazuronis, an MEP and head of the Labour party, one of the members of the current coalition, said Lithuania should not give any money to Greece.
It is time to say stop. Not a single penny to Greece until reforms are actually launched, he said. Further aid should only be granted if Greece takes real measures instead of another hocus-pocus.

The former French interior minister Charles Pasqua, who has died aged 88, was a totem of the French right, influential in shaping its hardline policies for more than 30 years. A resistance fighter turned henchman for General Charles de Gaulle and the power broker behind two centre-right presidents  Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy  Pasqua was best known for his tough stances on immigration, terrorism and crime.
Both the man, a blunt-speaking bruiser, and his views, based on virulent nationalism, polarised people. His devotion to his country was without question, but his deeply ingrained social conservatism and a series of allegations of pocketing public money and misuse of power earned him the nickname the Godfather of the Hauts-de-Seine, the area in the western suburbs of Paris where he lived and held court.
To the right, the former drinks salesman with his strong southern accent was a refreshing change from the graduates of the grandes coles who formed the overwhelming majority of Frances ruling elite. The left found his flirting with policies championed by the far-right Front National, including calls for zero immigration, and his paternalistic, authoritarian approach too hard to swallow.
He belonged to the generation of politicians who set the rightwing agenda that has persisted to the current day. Pasqua has been credited with many of the tough policies and the rhetoric of Sarkozy , currently leader of the opposition Republicans party (formerly the UMP) , to whom he was a mentor.
In a career that swerved in and out of the political and legal shadows, Pasqua occasionally gave the impression he believed himself accountable to no one, roundly batting away allegations of criminal activity, at least one of which led to a suspended prison sentence. It was an impression that Pasqua, with his hangdog jowls, cultivated with soundbite quotes. Democracy ends where the interests of the state begin, he once declared. We have to terrorise the terrorists. Promises are binding only on those who believe them.
The last of these would come back to bite him, as even close friends betrayed their promises, ensuring that for all his influence, bluster and larger than life presence, Pasqua would never make it to the very top of the French political ladder. Even his spell in government  he was interior minister from 1986 to 1988 and again from 1993 to 1995  was brief.
Pasqua was born in Grasse, Provence. His grandfather was a Corsican shepherd and his parents were migrants to the French mainland. Pasquas father, Andr, worked as a police officer and was a member of the resistance, and his mother, Franoise (nee Rinaldi), worked in the local perfume industry.
Pasqua left school at 15, joined the resistance and obtained a law degree, before taking a job selling pastis with the drinks company Ricard, where he rose to become the company number two.
As De Gaulle rode out the domestic turbulence caused by his opposition to, then support for, Algerian independence, Pasqua helped create the Service dAction Civique (SAC), a shadowy Gaullist militia known for its violent methods. During the May 1968 student riots, he controversially used the SAC to mobilise a patriotic counter-demonstration to prop up De Gaulles authority.
After helping Chirac to become prime minister in 1986, he was named interior minister despite the opposition of the then Socialist president Franois Mitterrand , who described Pasqua as that devil. He led an unsuccessful revolt against the 1992 Maastricht treaty, which introduced the euro, and in 1999 entered the European parliament as leader of his own anti-EU party, the Rassemblement pour la France.
Disillusioned with Chirac, Pasqua backed his rival Edouard Balladur in the 1995 presidential election. When Chirac won, Pasqua entered a political desert from which he never fully emerged, despite the growing influence of his young protege Sarkozy.
Among Pasquas legal entanglements was a 2009 conviction  later overturned  for allegedly arranging the sales of weapons during the Angolan civil war in the 1990s contrary to a UN arms embargo, and an accusation, vehemently denied, that he profited from the UNs oil-for-food programme in Iraq. He never spent a day in jail.
When he died suddenly, of a heart attack, he was still challenging a two-year suspended sentence for misappropriation of public funds.
Sarkozy said France had lost one of its most dedicated public servants ... He embodied a certain idea of politics and France , built on engagement, courage and convictions.
Pasqua remained a Gaullist to the core: from 2004 to 2011 he sat in the UMP group in the senate. In a statement, his family said: To him, politics was a battle in the service of France, with the loyalty of partners, with the respect of his opponents when they were driven, like him, by conviction and courage.
Pasqua is survived by his wife, Jeanne (nee Joly). The couples only child, Pierre-Philippe, died in February.

Charges against five bloggers and journalists held in Ethiopia for more than a year have been dropped, weeks before Barack Obamas planned visit to the country.
Five others also arrested in April 2014 remain in jail, accused of planning terrorist attacks and collaborating with the US-based opposition group Ginbot 7, labelled a terrorist organisation by Ethiopia.
The release of these five journalists is a welcome turn of events in Ethiopia , where the number of journalists in prison has steadily increased in recent years, said Tom Rhodes, east Africa representative at the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).
We call on authorities to release the remaining Zone 9 bloggers and all the journalists in jail for their work, and to drop all charges against them, he said in a statement on Thursday.
The CPJ said that at least 12 other journalists were still incarcerated, most of them facing terrorism charges, making Ethiopia the second-worst jailer of journalists in Africa , after its neighbour Eritrea.

Ethiopia is an ally of the west in the fight against Islamist extremism in east Africa, receiving millions of dollars in foreign aid, but has a dire record when it comes to human rights and press freedom.
In elections in May, the ruling Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Front coalition, in power since the end of a civil war in 1991, and its allies won every seat in parliament.
Obama is due to visit Ethiopia later this month as part of an Africa tour that includes a trip to Kenya, where his father was born. In Ethiopia, Obama is expected to meet the prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, and address the African Union at its Addis Ababa headquarters.
In the unexpected move on Wednesday, state prosecutors dropped all charges against journalists Asmamaw Hailegiorgis, Edom Kassaye and Tesfalem Waldyes, and bloggers Mahlet Fantahun and Zelalem Kibret.
Four other members of Zone 9 , a blogging collective, remain in prison while one other was charged in absentia. The Zone 9 website, proclaiming we blog because we care, features mostly social and political commentary, often critical of the government.

The US supreme courts landmark decision last month legalizing gay marriage across the United States was the best news Lus Felipe Rodrguez had heard in a long time.
Though the ruling had no direct impact on him, Rodrguez  who lives in the Colombian city of Cali  hopes it will help sway his countrys top court, which faces a similar decision based on a case he brought two years ago.
That was really positive news and it has created all sorts of expectation here in Colombia , he said.
Rodrguez and other gay rights activists across Latin America hope that the US supreme courts landmark decision makes waves in courts and parliaments throughout Latin America.
The US supreme court decision is an important precedent to advance marriage equality in Latin America, said Marcela Snchez, director of the Bogot based group Colombia Diversa.
On the heels of the US decision, the Colombian government has come out publicly in favor of marriage equality. Equality is unstoppable and equality will also come to Colombia, the interior minister, Juan Fernando Cristo, said.
And despite a long history of social conservatism and deeply rooted Catholic tradition, Latin American countries have been at the forefront of recognizing gay marriage or civil unions.
Mexico City became the first capital in Latin America to allow same-sex unions in 2009 . The following year, Argentina became the first country in the region to approve same-sex marriages nationwide. Brazil followed suit with a federal court ruling in May 2013, and Uruguay enacted a same-sex marriage law in August of the same year. Civil unions between gays are recognized in Colombia, Chile and Ecuador.
A week before the US supreme court made its ruling, its counterpart in Mexico did something similar, though to much less fanfare.
Although only the capital and two of Mexicos 31 states  Quintana Roo and Coahuila  explicitly allow for marriage equality, the supreme court had consistently ruled against state laws barring same-sex unions.
Following decisions on five individual cases the court followed up in June with general ruling, known as a jurisprudential thesis, stating that laws restricting marriage to heterosexual couples were discriminatory and unconstitutional.
As the purpose of matrimony is not procreation, there is no justified reason that the matrimonial union be heterosexual, nor that it be stated as between only a man and only a woman, the ruling found.
That landmark ruling was the result of a low-key legal strategy which contrasted starkly with the broad movement for change north of the border.
It started as a small idea to help three specific couples [in Oaxaca], and I never thought it would generate what came later, said Mexico City-based activist and lawyer Alex Ali Mndez.
The ruling effectively put an end to the debate in Mexico, but in Colombia gay couples have been in limbo for the past two years. A 2011 constitutional court recognized same-sex couples as families and ordered the congress to pass a law that would afford gay couples the same rights as in a heterosexual marriage. If lawmakers failed to pass a law by June 2013, by default gay couples could formalize their unions before notaries and judges.
But the courts language was vague, and when Rodrguez and his partner Ramiro Chvez went to tie the knot, the notary told them they could not be married  but they could enter into a solemn contract.

You are either married or single. There is no such marital status as in a solemn contract, says Rodrguez, a 25-year-old language teacher. He challenged the notarys decision not to carry out the marriage and on 30 July, the constitutional court will hold a public hearing, before handing down its decision.
Activists in Colombia are hopeful that history  and legal precedent  is on their side, but marriage equality in Latin America still faces steep opposition. Same-sex unions or marriage are not recognized in any form in Peru, Venezuela, Paraguay and in most Central American and Caribbean countries.
Even in countries where marriage equality has been enshrined in law, the general population is not entirely convinced.
Among the countries were gay marriage is legal in Latin America, Uruguay is the only one where a majority (62%) supports it, according to a survey by the Pew Research Center taken in 2013 and 2014. About half of Argentinians and Mexicans favor gay marriage, according to the survey, while support in Brazil is at 45%.
In Chile, where same-sex unions were approved this year, 46% favor allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry.
Meanwhile, 80% of Paraguayans, 74% of Ecuadorans and 64% of Colombians say they oppose same-sex marriage. In Central America about three-quarters or more of Hondurans, Guatemalans, Salvadorans and Nicaraguans are against gay marriage.
Javier Surez, a Colombian opponent of same-sex marriage, says the US court decision sets a bad example for Latin America. If in the United States they say yes [to gay marriage] that doesnt mean we have to say yes here because the cultural and historical context is different, he says.
Surez, who heads an organization called Marido y Mujer (Husband and Wife) , says he has personally challenged 76 civil marriages between same-sex couples performed by judges in Colombia since the 2013, leaving the couples in legal limbo until the constitutional court rules on the broader issue.
Surez says if gay marriage is approved in Colombia, hell challenge it before the international criminal court.
But if it doesnt, the issue could end up in the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights, which is becoming the court of last recourse for gay couples in Latin America who have exhausted all possibilities in their own countries.
Couples from Chile, Costa Rica, Mexico and Paraguay have filed complaints with the commission, which refers cases to the inter-American court of human rights, whose rulings affect all of Latin America. The court has yet to rule on a same-sex marriage case specifically, but in a case where a Chilean mother lost custody of her children because she was lesbian, the court said any discrimination based on sexual orientation violates the Inter-American Convention on Human Rights. A right that is recognized for people cannot be denied or restricted under any circumstance on the basis of sexual orientation, it said.
That sets the tone for the cases on same-sex marriage throughout the region and perhaps for Colombias constitutional court.
If the court green-lights gay marriage, Rodrguez says friends are trying to convince him to throw a blowout wedding in the colonial Caribbean coast city of Cartagena  a favorite destination for honeymoon couples.
It could happen, he said. It just might.

Two Indonesian pilots who appear to have been influenced by pro-Islamic State elements are being monitored by Australian Federal Police over concerns they may pose a security threat, an intelligence website says.
The alleged radicalisation of Ridwan Agustin, alias Hobi Panahan, and Tommy Hendratno, alias Tomi Abu Alfatih, was detailed in an 18 March operational intelligence report compiled by the AFP and obtained by website The Intercept .
The AFP report  marked for official use only  analyses Facebook posts by the two pilots that appear to support Isis.
The Intercept reports that Agustin formerly worked for AirAsia Indonesia , while Premiair says Hendratno ceased working for them on 1 June.
Agustin graduated from the AirAsia academy in 2010 and flew international and domestic routes, the intelligence report states.
He began posting material indicating his support for Isis from September 2014  posts which Hendratno liked.
The AFP also noted that Agustin had commented on the page of Heri Kustyanto, who its believed left his Indonesian family to fight with Isis in Syria or Iraq.
At the time of the report, Agustin was active on Facebook as Hobi Panahan, was befriending radicals, and listed his current city as Raqqa, Syria.
The AFP report says Hendratno, meanwhile, lives in Bogor, near Jakarta, and was a pilot for the Indonesian Navy before Garuda and Premiair.
He had posted photos of trips around the world, including to Australia, but by December 2014 was posting pro-Islamic State material. His friends list included many military and commercial pilots.
The report concluded that pilots, if they become radicalised, were an obvious threat, as witnessed by past global events and noted that a recent edition of the al-Qaeda magazine had encouraged aviation attacks. Both men were trained pilots with contacts in the industry, it said.
The AFP distributed the report to partners in Turkey, Jordan, London, the US and Europol, The Intercept reported.
In a statement, the AFP said it did not comment on matters of intelligence.
The AFP maintains strong relationships with its domestic and foreign law enforcement partners to ensure the ongoing safety of Australians both within Australia and abroad, it said.
The Intercept was initially created to report on documents provided by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.

A Thai court hearing the case of two Burmese men accused of murdering two British backpackers stalled on the second day of a three-month trial after a police officer failed to present what the defence says is key DNA evidence.
The head judge on a panel of three in a court on the tropical holiday-making island of Koh Samui said that he would rule on the matter on Thursday, when Police Lieutenant Colonel Somsak Nurod, who is believed to hold evidence related to the case, would appear to testify.
But Nurod spent only a few minutes in the court, where he showed the judge of list of evidence exhibits.
This included the alleged murder weapon, a hoe, which was used to kill Hannah Witheridge, 23, from Norfolk and David Miller, 24, from Jersey on Sairee beach on the nearby Koh Tao island on September 15.
He left shortly after to recheck what other evidence was available. It was not immediately clear if DNA evidence, collected from sperm and cigarette found at the crime scene, would be provided to the defence.
Nurod appeared confused in court when asked to provide forensic evidence. He said the samples may have been destroyed.
Lead defence lawyer Nakhon Chompuchat said that the police officer will ring the defence later today to confirm what evidence he has.
Some of the forensic with him has already be used up. Some things he is not sure about, he said.
Asked if he is disappointed that it appears that key DNA evidence may be missing or unusable, Chompuchat said: We expected this before.
He added that it was important that the court acknowledges these fact, which cast doubts on the fairness of the trial and the reliability of the evidence.
Another judge had ruled in April that the DNA evidence be reexamined but later said the defence should request the order on the first day of trial.
A verdict is expected during October for the criminal trial of Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo, two Burmese migrants who worked in a bar on a restaurant on Koh Toa. Witnesses, including police, doctors and people living on the island, are due to testify until September 25.
Andy Hall, a migrants rights activist from Britain who is working for the defence, has told the Guardian that recent information provided by UK authorities has raised a lot of very important inconsistencies between the Thai evidence and the the evidence from the UK.
He did not give details on what evidence UK authorities had provided. But Metropolitan police detectives were sent to Thailand in 2014 to look over the case and report back to officials and the families.
For this case to rest, its very important to re-examine that DNA material and find out whose DNA profile it really is, Hall said.
The legal team representing the 22-year-old bar workers is made up of pro-bono lawyers also criticise Thai police for improperly collecting evidence at the crime scene, intimidation and abuse of witnesses. These claims have been denied by the Thai police. Human rights groups including Amnesty International have become involved in the trial, noting that Burmese migrant workers, of whom there are about 2.5 million, have previously been wrongly accused of crimes by Thai police.
On Wednesday, the defence cross-examined another police officer who was second on the scene in the early hours of the day of the crime. They asked him why he took so long to call a medic and seal of the area. He was also asked why he moved Millers body. He said he was concern the deceased would float in the current.
Doctor Chasit Yoohat, 51, a doctor on Koh Tao, also testified. He said that he observed the crime scene on the day of the murder, and found both had been brutally attacked. On Thursday, Steve Mitchell, a bar owner who was the last person to photograph the deceased appeared at court. He told reporters outside that he photographs tourists to promote the bar on the website.
The two defendants said last night their shackles were not removed, speaking during a break in the hearings on Thursday. I didnt sleep all night, Wai Phyo said.
The authorities had been under pressure to solve this particular murder case quickly as it threatens the countrys vital tourism industry.
The family of Miller said in a statement on Wednesday: The act which ended Davids life devastated our family and his friends. Just hours before he died, David was talking to us with his usual enthusiasm, describing the beauty of Koh Tao and the friendliness of the Thai people.
Over the coming weeks we hope to gain a better understanding as to how such a wonderful young man lost his life in such idyllic surroundings in such a horrible way.

How community-led renovation is helping a rundown Pittsburgh neighbourhood fight crime

Dorothea Burke is standing in the street, staring at her house. Its a warm day in late May and after a hard Pittsburgh winter, Burke and many of her neighbours are in home improvement mode. Drills and power saws blare in the background. New windows are going in across the street and the house next to it is on the market. Facing her house, Burke, a 23-year resident of this block, is thinking about repointing her brickwork and maybe a paint job. People are finally taking pride in their homes, she says.
For this neighbourhood, East Liberty, once one of the citys most dangerous and crime-ridden, the air of optimism and reinvestment is a stark contrast to darker days in the recent past.
It wasnt peaceful before, Burke says. A few years ago, two teenagers tried to rob an older neighbour who protected himself by shooting them both dead. From her balcony, she would watch police lights flashing on a problem house at the corner  sometimes after gunshots, but mostly for drugs. It was almost a weekly thing, she recalls. Then, a couple years ago, the property got new management, she says, and the cops stopped coming.
To many here who lived through years or decades of instability , it seems the entire neighbourhood is under new management. Crime is down. Vacant lots and abandoned homes are being redeveloped. Property values are rising. The streets are feeling safe and calm.
They were the worst public housing projects in the region and they were anchoring our neighbourhood

Much of this transition is the work of East Liberty Development Inc , a community development corporation that has systematically bought abandoned homes and criminal hotspots, bought out slumlords throughout the 400-acre neighbourhood and redeveloped the properties into stable, well-managed, affordable and market-rate housing. We took on a huge risk, says Kendall Pelling, ELDIs director of land recycling. We owned the 250 worst properties in a blighted neighbourhood and wed borrowed most of the money to get them. But the risk paid off: violent crime dropped roughly in half , and, for the first time in decades, homebuyers are looking at East Liberty as a place to live.
Its a long awaited rebirth. In the early 20th century, the neighbourhood was a thriving commercial district that many called the second downtown of a city made prosperous by the steel and glass industries. But a 1960s urban renewal project drained much of the neighbourhoods vitality and concentrated its poverty in large public housing projects. One of those towers literally rose up and straddled the areas main thoroughfare, creating an intimidating gateway to the neighbourhood. People would throw stuff out of their windows at you when you drove through, recalls ELDI executive director Maelene Myers, who has been with the organisation since 1996. They were the worst public housing projects in the region and they were anchoring our neighbourhood, says Pelling. East Liberty became a neighbourhood to avoid.
Decades of cyclical poverty and disinvestment ensued. Deindustrialisation more than halved the citys peak population of 676,000 in 1950. Then, in 1999, a community plan was drafted to reshape East Liberty. The big public housing projects were demolished and replaced with mid- and low-rise, mixed use and mixed income developments. New commercial development was encouraged. In 2002, a Whole Foods grocery store opened. An Ace Hotel is in the works . Things started to change, if slowly.

But on its residential streets, long-term problems persisted. Blocks littered with abandoned homes and vacant lots became magnets for crime. Property values hovered around $50,000  low for the city  but most of those homes needed at least that much in renovations and repairs, so many sat and continued to decay.
ELDI began buying empty lots and abandoned or foreclosed homes and making the piecemeal investments to turn them into quality homes. But the scale of the problem was huge. The standard community development approach was woefully inadequate, says Pelling. We had 80 abandoned houses in the neighbourhood. Doing two or three of them wasnt going to change the market.
Around the corner is a building ELDI bought after the US Marshals seized it from a major cocaine distributor
As a non-profit developer embedded in the community, ELDI met regularly with residents to hear their concerns and ideas. When talk inevitably turned to crime, a recurrent worry was slumlords  hands-off landlords who had, through neglect, allowed their properties to be used for criminal activities. Drugs, prostitution and violence were common, and though their negative impacts spread across East Liberty, the sources were a relatively small amount of buildings. All the neighbours knew exactly who was dealing. They know who his grandmother is. But the police have to build a case for that and its a slow process, Pelling says of the slumlord-crime connection. We knew it, but it scared the hell out of us.
In 2003, ELDI decided that the only way to stop that problem was to remove the slumlords. It doesnt matter if its a 14-storey tower with no management and bad conditions or a 3-storey house with no management and bad conditions, its the same damn thing, says Eric Jester, who worked with Pelling to spearhead the slumlord buyout program but who has since left ELDI. By 2007, ELDI developed a viable financial model to begin a large-scale buyout of some of the slumlords many neighbours had complained about for years. One of its first major buyouts  an $8.2m project  turned a scattered group of decaying buildings and empty lots into 41 units of mixed income housing.
Walking through the neighbourhood recently, Pelling points out some of the properties ELDI has acquired  homes where people had been murdered and prostitution thrived. He passes an apartment building where the hallways were basically 24-hour drug markets. Around the corner is a building they bought after the US Marshals service seized it from a major cocaine distributor. I still have a full 9mm clip that fell out of the drop ceiling, Pelling says. Its my paper weight.

Through its targeted slumlord buyout program, ELDI bought up more than 200 housing units in the neighbourhood, about 3% of the total housing stock. They contracted a property manager to screen and remove problematic tenants. For the most troubled properties, off-duty police officers were hired to make random patrols. Based on neighbourhood feedback, a few properties have been redeveloped as supportive housing, one for women in recovery and another for chronically homeless men. One row of houses has developed into a co-housing community, with a big shared garden.
While still at ELDI, Jester made a personal bet on East Liberty. In the mid 2000s, he bought a home in its most active crime hotspot  the worst end of the worst block, he says. But over the years, ELDI has gradually bought and redeveloped many homes on this problem block, and Jester has watched as the crime has nearly disappeared. To see if numbers would support his observations, Jester pulled crime statistics and had a map made to show how the incidence of crime changed. On his block, a former red blotch of repeated crimes and arrests, the incidence of crime dropped significantly in just a few years.
ELDI was cooling East Libertys criminal hotspots through real estate development. To better understand why, ELDI commissioned a study from Pittsburgh-based consultants Numeritics , which tracked the incidence of crime against the locations of ELDIs interventions.
The correlations were clear: where ELDI invested and rehabilitated properties, the crime gradually decreased. Between 2008 and 2012, serious crimes against persons  aggravated assault, homicide, rape and robbery  decreased by 54% in East Libertys residential areas. Total crime  including property crimes and crimes reported in the commercial center of East Liberty  dropped from 221 crimes per thousand residents in 2008 to 164 crimes per thousand residents in 2012.

The idea that community development is a mechanism to address crime is not new at all. Its just demonstrated vividly in this case, says Alex Schwartz, a professor of urban policy at the New School in New York and an expert in community development. There are various reasons for investing in housing and engaging in housing revitalisation. Part of it is providing more affordable housing, but its also to remove blight or address other neighbourhood problems. So this is an example of some of these other ancillary benefits of community development.
Change is underway. Walking through East Liberty, theres hardly a block without at least one home on the market and others undergoing renovations. Trucks with construction materials rumble down streets and stacks of two-by-fours sit on the sidewalks. More white families are moving into what has long been a predominantly black neighbourhood. A teenage couple walks hand in hand after school, and a group of boys on bikes gathers near a corner. Down the block, a few slightly older males snicker as they walk in the late afternoon sun, holding cans of malt liquor. The grit of a tough neighbourhood hasnt completely disappeared.
Justin Cummings, a real estate agent whos lived in the neighbourhood for about nine years, says things have been improving. He recently bought two houses side by side  one for his family and one to rent. As he waters plants in his large backyard, he points across the street to a house where someone had been murdered a few years ago, and to a place around the corner where a crack dealer was recently arrested. But in the near-decade hes lived in East Liberty, hes seen the incidence and concentration of crime drop. It was block by block five years ago, he says. Now its house by house.

A few streets over, Dee Peters is tending to her modest front garden. A 13-year resident, she says things have calmed in recent years, but still flare up, especially during summer. Shes noticed the work of ELDI, but says its up to residents to create more systemic change. When things go wrong, were the ones calling the police because were the ones that live here. They dont, she says.
Some worry that ELDIs interventions may lead to wealthier people displacing the neighbourhoods poorer residents. Pelling argues thats unlikely, as most of the housing ELDI has developed or renovated is permanent affordable housing for people with low incomes. You cant have a gentrifying neighbourhood where 38% of the units are subsidised affordable rentals, he says. Its impossible.
But its clear that this approach has led to some inevitable displacement. The property managers contracted by ELDI can essentially blacklist problem tenants from renting in any of their controlled properties. During a tour of the neighbourhood, Pelling is approached by one such former tenant, clearly down on her luck, inquiring about any openings. He tells her no, there isnt anything available right now, but she suspects thats not the full truth. Did I do something wrong? she asks, over and over. Pelling eventually concedes: because of the problems shed caused in the past, the property manager doesnt want to rent to her. Pelling tells her hell see what he can do, but the situation is unlikely to change. ELDIs approach to reducing the incidence of crime relies squarely on removing those individuals who cause or enable that crime.

Since 2002, ELDI has acquired and stabilised more than 500 rental units, which accounts for 20% of the neighbourhoods rental stock. Though the transformation from East Libertys past is by no means comprehensive, ELDIs intervention in the neighbourhood has been uniquely strategic, according to Stefani Danes, a research associate at the Remaking Cities Institute at Carnegie Mellon university in Pittsburgh. They recognised that their resources are very limited, so they made a deliberate decision to focus resources where they would make the biggest difference, she says. But she also notes that the shortage of funding has limited this approach. Shes tracked the impacts of ELDIs work and has noticed that blocks with more buyouts have fared much better than those with just a few. One, the 700 block of Collins Street, she says, is still deteriorating. The investment that was made in a couple of properties hasnt turned it around and those properties are now vulnerable to more deterioration. Thats the risk when you spread your investment around in many different blocks.
ELDI has relied on low-interest loans from local banks and the support of foundations to be able to acquire these properties. A city programme enables ELDI to buy abandoned homes for only a few thousand dollars, but those still need upwards of $100,000 in work. ELDI is heavily reliant on receiving tax credits for the creation of low-income housing, but those dont always come through. Through a homeowner programme, ELDI sells some renovated homes at both affordable and market rates to help subsidise its work on the riskier projects that are less likely to break even. More than 100 units have been built or renovated for sale, at an investment of more than $25m.
Funding remains a challenge, which has been frustrating for Pelling. But hes hoping the crime reduction numbers theyve helped produce will encourage institutional lenders to ease their lending restrictions and the city to offer more generous tax credits to help ELDI expand this effort.
In this country, weve tried everything else to reduce crime, Pelling says. Why not try this?

Tokyo readies for the rise of the 'guerrilla rainstorm'
Japans capital may be known for its earthquake resilience strategies, but a recent increase in intense, sudden storms poses another threat  one that the citys flood protection systems may not be able to manage

When people speak of natural disasters in Tokyo , they usually mean the major earthquake that seismologists say will eventually strike the Japanese capital. But for the local government, weather-related disasters are as much if not more of an immediate worry. The citys coastal location puts it in the path of the Asia-Pacific regions most violent typhoons  and there has been a measurable increase in the strength of rainstorms in recent years.
Tokyos rainfall in 2014 was about 20% above normal, but the kind of storms that have struck the capital lately are different than they were in the past. Many are caused by huge cumulus clouds that form quickly and in succession when moist air from the ocean comes up against the warm air trapped among tall, closely packed buildings. Locally, these sudden, intense downpours are called guerrilla storms, because they seem to attack out of nowhere.
Two years ago, four workers who were reinforcing storm sewers drowned when such a storm hit unexpectedly. The main problem in these situations is that Tokyo is covered with concrete and has many levels of underground infrastructure: there is no ground soil to absorb water. The city has two sewer systems, one for runoff and one for sewage, and when rainfall exceeds 50mm/hour the water is diverted automatically into the sewage channels, which fill up and have to be diverted into the sea, meaning raw sewage ends up in the environment without being treated. Last year, during one storm, Taito Ward in eastern Tokyo received 150mm in one hour.

Tokyo is covered with concrete  there is no ground soil to absorb water
About 30% of the prefectures population lives below sea level, mostly along Tokyo Bay or the many rivers that feed into it. The levees that were built roughly 300 years ago to protect the downstream areas havent always been sufficient. In 1948, Typhoon Kathleen submerged most of the northwestern portion of the city under three metres of water when the Tone River breached its banks. More than 1,000 people died and 31,000 homes were destroyed. The storm was considered a once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon, and the low-lying areas have become even more populated in the intervening years, with landfill extending far into the bay. Levees have been reinforced, but the metropolitan government knows it is not enough.
One of the biggest recent flood prevention projects is an underground discharge channel that was completed six years ago about 25 miles north of the city in Kasukabe. The structure feeds overflow from five rivers into a man-made underground reservoir through a huge shaft and a tunnel more than 4 miles in length. Four pumps can handle as much as 200 cubic metres of water a second. The mechanism goes a long way toward diverting excess water that flows down from the upper reaches of the Kanto Plain, but may have less effect in the event of heavy rains that fall directly on the city.

Ward governments have asked private property owners to build special runoff systems under their land so that when there is excess rain it can be absorbed into the soil, alleviating the citys burden for runoff. Some even offer to subsidise such construction, but without regulations that compel landowners to do so, few have undertaken the work.
Experts dont think that structural precautions alone can safeguard a city such as Tokyo from extraordinary storms
Another flood-prevention project is the super levees that the central government is attempting to build along 540 miles of six rivers. The work involves increasing the elevation of existing levees. But if they are made higher, the base has to be widened in order for them to maintain their structural integrity, and since tightly packed residential neighbourhoods are already situated along the levees, houses have to be condemned and residents forced to move when the work is carried out. Japan has a very weak concept of eminent domain, and between the late 1980s when the project began and 2012 when it was suspended temporarily due to budget concerns, only 5.4% of the planned work had been done. At that rate it will take 400 years to complete, and many people in and out of the government believe the project is merely a public works boondoggle that has more to do with enriching construction companies than with saving lives.
In any case, experts dont think that structural precautions alone can safeguard a city such as Tokyo from extraordinary storms. This spring, Japans public broadcaster, NHK, aired a series of special programmes on mega-disasters, one of which addressed guerrilla rainstorms and super typhoons. Worst case scenarios were simulated using computer graphics, showing how subways and underground spaces would be completely inundated and streets submerged under at least three metres of water. Though such a situation would be rare, it is also seen as inevitable. Consequently, more research has gone into predicting heavy rainfall, especially when its focused on a small area.

As NHK pointed out, the best way to save lives is to make sure residents know when a storm is coming and what they can expect in their area. Local governments distribute hazard maps that tell residents whether or not their localities are subject to inundation, whether by overwhelmed sewers or by overflowing tributaries. Combined with a storm prediction system, residents can evacuate when a warning is given. This summer, a system devised by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism that predicts rain storms of more than 30mm/hour is being tested that can give ten minute warnings to affected areas.
Ten minutes isnt much time, but if people decide to evacuate, where do they go, especially if they live in a neighbourhood thats below sea level? Local governments designate evacuation points in multi-story public buildings, such as schools, but depending on where a resident lives it could be a long walk  and authorities warn against moving around outside during a flood. Some communities are making their own arrangements. Yoshii Ishii, the 83-year-old head of the neighbourhood association of Minami Senju, a cramped warren of wooden houses located near the Sumida River, told us three years ago that he had come to an understanding with several high-rise condominiums that had been built in the area since 2000. We had a meeting, he said. They said we can use their building in the event of an emergency.
The proliferation of tower condos in recent years has been controversial for their performance in earthquakes, but tall buildings also exacerbate the heat island phenomenon that contributes to guerrilla storms. For the residents of Minami Senju, however, skyscrapers make up for the flooding they could be indirectly causing by providing higher, drier ground.

On 29 August 2005, Hurricane Katrina , one of the US deadliest hurricanes, reached New Orleans. What followed crippled the city, causing loss of life and destroying peoples homes. The levee system designed to protect the city from storm surges failed disastrously and the large majority of Greater New Orleans was severely flooded. Less than a month later, Hurricane Rita added insult to injury.
Recovery and rebuilding efforts drew mass attention, not least for their celebrity spearheading . As well as repairing the damage and restoring the city, projects have tried to ensure greater resilience for the future . One currently in progress is a hurricane-proof hospital , designed upside-down so the emergency room is above the flood line.
It is now approaching 10 years since Hurricane Katrina. No one wants another major natural disaster to hit, but if it did, what would be its impact? Is New Orleans now stronger and better protected? Is each neighbourhood as prepared as the next?
If you live in New Orleans, share your thoughts, stories, images and videos on whether the city feels stronger since Katrina. What has been done to increase disaster preparedness? Do you feel more protected than before Katrina? What else would you like to see happen to make New Orleans more resilient?

        <title>Radioactive city: how Johannesburg’s townships are paying for its mining past</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jul/06/radioactive-city-how-johannesburgs-townships-are-paying-for-its-mining-past</Link>

Johannesburgs mine dumps look strangely beautiful from a distance. Lustrously yellow in the sun, blazing red at dusk, their huge molehill shapes provide the city with its distinctive skyline.
Up close, its a different story. Rasalind Plaatjies has lived in the shadow of a tailing  as these piles of mine waste are known  all her adult life. Today, the 62-year-old grandmother from the citys Riverlea district suffers severe respiratory problems. For 16 hours a day, she is hooked up to an oxygen tank, her lungs debilitated by dust from the waste heap.
Sometimes I dont have the energy to get up. I just have to stay in bed and do nothing, she says. She feels fortunate, though. A number of her elderly neighbours have died from respiratory disease.
Plaatjies is one of tens of thousands in Johannesburgs impoverished townships who are paying a high cost for the citys rich mining past. More than 600 abandoned mines surround South Africas largest city, with much of their waste now piled up high next to residential communities  most of which are poor and black.

Residents here fear the wind most. When it blows, fine particles from these man-made dumps are carried up into the air and deposited on to residents homes. It is no ordinary dust, either: the residue of decades of mining, it can contain traces of everything from copper and lead to cyanide and arsenic .
During August and September, the dust is terrible. You stop cleaning the floor after a while. Its just useless, says Plaatjies.
In the local clinic, respiratory cases such as tuberculosis and asthma are ubiquitous across all age groups, says Musa Mbatha, chairman of the clinics civic committee. Rashes and skins diseases are commonplace, too.
People cant afford to buy food every day, so they leave the food and it gets contaminated, Mbatha adds. The government said that it would do a survey of the health impacts of the mining dust, but until today it hasnt happened.
Johannesburg is undoubtedly the most uranium-contaminated city in the world
Dr Antony Turton
An even more dangerous pollutant is lurking in Johannesburgs mine dumps, however: radioactive waste. According to one university study, an estimated 600,000 metric tonnes of radioactive uranium are buried in waste rock in and around Johannesburg  around three times what was exported during the Cold War .
[Johannesburg] is undoubtedly the most uranium-contaminated city in the world, says Dr Antony Turton, a professor at the University of Free States Centre for Environmental Management.
Uranium naturally occurs in reefs alongside gold, meaning the two are often excavated at the same time. For every tonne of gold mined in the Witwatersrand gold fields  the southern sections of which border western Johannesburg  between 10 and 100 tonnes of uranium were also mined .

For most of the gold mines, uranium was merely a waste product and therefore dumped without being recovered. Those tailing disposal facilities therefore have a relatively high uranium concentration today, Turton says.
Without the proper precautions in place, ore-bearing uranium leaches from the tailings and enters as run-off into surrounding streams and wetlands. A similar process occurs in abandoned mines underground, with polluted water seeping through porous rock as the mines flood.
Despite its vast reserves of groundwater, Johannesburg pumps most of its drinking water from Lesotho  more than 380km away  because its own water reserves are too polluted.

Mine waste is also removed illegally from tailings for use in the manufacture of bricks and for other construction purposes, some environment groups allege. Potentially, the physical infrastructure of Johannesburg could be becoming radioactive as well.
The release of uranium in dust form can be exacerbated by the re-mining of tailings  a process that happens in various locations across the city. The companies involved in this re-mining maintain that they are providing an environmental service by removing waste and depositing it in modern tailings that are better regulated.
David van Wyk, chief researcher at the Bench Marks Foundation , a church-funded non-profit based in Johannesburg, is sceptical about mining companies environmental practices. When the uranium price is very low, the mining companies simply dump it. Thats why the dust is yellow. We call it yellow cake, he says.
Bench Marks, which receives support from UK charity Christian Aid , is mid-way through a three-year impact assessment of pollution levels in an around Johannesburgs Soweto district. By systematically tracking air and water contamination, Bench Marks hopes to provide a scientific basis for the alleged health impacts of the tailings.
A handful of randomised spot-checks reveal the extent of the pollution problem. For example, in a narrow run-off canal immediately opposite Soccer City, site of the 2010 Fifa World Cup final, van Wyk picks out the colours along the bank: red for iron, white for sulphur, green for copper, yellow for uranium, and so on.
The pH level measures 4.6: within the range for acid rain (neutral water has a pH level of 7). The figure for Total Dissolved Solids (a measure of minerals, metals and other insoluble materials), meanwhile, is 2,000 parts per million  four times higher than the guideline amount in the US .

When it floods, this just goes straight into the river. Youd expect the government to check that the mine water isnt spilling into local watercourses, but they are not, van Wyk says. This is happening in the centre of South Africas largest city, close to the Department of Environmental Affairs s main office. If they cant regulate so close to their headquarters, just imagine how bad it is elsewhere?
A few miles away, the township of Diepkloof in Soweto catches the run-off from several large tailings. A few hundred feet from residents front doors, a run-off canal has burst its banks. A hardened white wasteland now stands where reeds and plants used to grow. A lifeless stream runs next to it. The soils surface, meanwhile, is scuffed with the imprint of cattle hoofs and childrens feet. The soil has a pH of 2.67  more acidic than vinegar.
Just downstream, an evangelical church carries out full-immersion baptisms in the water, points out Charles van der Merme, a representative of the non-profit Mining and Environmental Justice Community Network of South Africa . They think they are cleansing themselves, he says. Who knows? Perhaps it kills all the devils in you.

Bench Marks does not currently have a Geiger counter, but even the Chamber of Mines of South Africa admits that radioactive contamination is a major problem.
Five years ago, the government identified 36 priority areas affected by radioactive acid mine drainage for remediation . Today, not a single one of these sites has a feasible implementation strategy in place. According to the Cancer Association of South Africa , the health of up to 400,000 people could be affected.
Its totally inappropriate that communities live on waste that is widely accepted to be toxic and radioactive, says Mariette Liefferink, chief executive of the Federation for a Sustainable Environment .

According to the Chamber of Mines, all current re-mining meets regulations that prohibit radioactive contamination run-off. The problem lies instead with the owners of historic dumps that cannot be traced or are not in a position to take responsibility for the required remedial measures, the industry body states.
For its part, DRD Gold, which is currently involved in secondary gold mining of the Diepkloof tailing, says it is constantly searching for new methods of dust suppression. Among the measures it is currently using are netting and vegetation growth . Neither were visible on the Diepkloof dump, however.
According to the company, DRD Gold spends up to R48m (2.5m) a year managing the environmental impacts of its operations, which stretch over 70km around the city. Any [pollution] readings that exceed the legal limits are automatically flagged and managed in terms of an automated action list, a company spokesperson stated.
For those living in the shadow of the dumps, a sense of hopelessness pervades. Sixty-two-year-old Stella Adams, a long-term resident of Diepkloof, has written to numerous government departments to complain about the high levels of dust in her home. All I am asking for is some vegetation [on the tailing]. I am just asking for the most basic thing, she says. But nobody has ever given me a hearing  so I have lost hope.

Adamss grandson developed asthma shortly after moving into her home six years ago. Her sister recently died from lung cancer, despite never having smoked. Adams assumed the cancer was hereditary, so made no mention to doctors of the nearby tailing. Now I wonder if it had to do with the mine after all.
As well as cancer, high radioactive levels are linked to other health risks such as Parkinsons disease, Alzheimers, neurotoxic syndromes and growth deficiencies. Even so, residents in Johannesburgs poor townships have little choice but to stick it out.
In the Soweto district of Meadowlands, for example, hundreds of government-built houses are currently going up in the Fleurhof extension community. Mine dumps tower above the development on all sides. Yet, despite knowing the dangers, 41-year-old Charles van der Merme says he would move there in a flash.
One of the millions of unemployed residents in this city of 4.8 million, he and his family currently live with his parents-in-law in the township of Riverlea. I applied for a government house in 2000 and Im still homeless, van der Merme says. Despite all the ills from the mine dumps, I would like a house of my own. Where else can I go?

        <title>The human cost of the Tbilisi floods: 'The truth is, I'd really lost all hope'</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jul/03/tbilisi-floods-georgia-capital-destroyed-zoo-wild-animals</Link>

While viewers around the world were entranced by TV images of wild animals wandering free in the streets of Tbilisi, residents of the Georgian capital faced up to the human and material cost of the floods that hit on 13 June. The flooding, which left 19 people dead and caused damage put at $50 million (32m), was the biggest natural disaster to befall the city in living memory.
With the painful and slow cleanup operation still ongoing, Tbilisis residents are now asking whether this disaster was a freak, unpredictable occurrence  or whether its location and history of poor urban planning has left this city of 1.1 million people more vulnerable than they had realised.
Georgias environment minister, Gigla Agulashvili, stands on the edge of the Tskneti-Betania road in the hills above Tbilisi . This is the site where, during a night of exceptionally heavy rains, up to a million cubic metres of earth slid down the cliff into the Vere valley, sending a massive torrent of mud and tree trunks storming into the heart of the city.
About 60% of the land mass remains on the hillside, Agulashvili tells me. A lawyer by education, the minister of the environment has become intimately familiar with the geology of the city since the disaster struck. In heavy rains it could start to move again  but were not expecting such huge precipitation in the near future.

Behind where the minister is speaking, the ground has fallen away into a gaping pit of rocks, earth and broken trees that goes on for four kilometres. In the distance, a group of geology students huddles around a ministry official who is elucidating the workings of a new landslide early-warning system being installed in the area.
Within minutes of the Vere river breaking its banks, the flood waters had filled Keti Kurashvilis first-floor apartment up to 25cm from the ceiling. She made a narrow escape by forcing open the front door and clinging to the iron bars on the window. I just kept thinking, how can I die in all this mud? A dead dog floated up to me and touched my legs, but I kicked it with my foot and the current took it away.
Sitting with her granddaughter in her hotel accommodation, Kurashvili pauses half way through her story and starts to cry. In the corner of the room, donations of food and clothing are stuffed into thin plastic bags. To tell you the truth, Id really lost all hope, she says. I thought: OK, thats it  its over.
Generally, were seeing post-traumatic stress, anxiety and extreme neurosis, says psychotherapist Maia Begashvili, wearily drawing on a cigarette in the lobby of the modest hotel that is temporarily housing Kurashvili and other homeless flood victims. Along with her colleagues from the local mental health NGO Dendroni, Begashvili has been providing free visits to displaced families since the floods hit. Given the extent of the trauma, she says, she expects to be working with some of the children for at least a year.

The citys authorities have faced criticism for the lack of an emergency response plan
Begashvili lists the problems facing those who have lost their homes: The change in living space, the change in economic situation, the change in social environment ... this is all stressful, she says. Its hard for them to get over it. If they dont get treatment, they could develop the clinical symptoms of various illnesses.
The citys authorities have faced criticism for not having an emergency response plan in place. Some have pointed out they could have at least closed the Vere valley road upon hearing about the massive landslide outside the city. Others have accused the emergency services of responding slowly to the incident. When I first rang the emergency number, no one was there, Kurashvili tells me, and when I called again later, there was still no answer. Do you call that prepared?
Many of those affected are asking why they were not told about the risks of living close to the Vere river  which, for most of the year, is no more than a shallow stream. Much of the criticism is focused on the construction tunnels built to channel the river around the zoo from 1960s onwards. Further tunnels, built under a new arterial road in the Vere valley in 2012, became clogged with debris during the flooding, directing the surging flood waters towards adjacent residential areas.
When they built tunnels around the area of the zoo, even after the floods in the 1960s, its clear the wrong decisions were made, Agulashvili says. They kept building these tunnels and illegally issuing building permits to private individuals without considering the risks.
The future of Tbilisis zoo itself hangs in the balance. According to the zoos director, about half of the animals died in the flooding, and those that survived or were rescued from the citys streets are being housed in enclosures on higher ground.
The location of the zoo in a river valley next to several major intersections was long questioned by animal rights campaigners, but plans to relocate the zoo were dropped after a change of government in 2012. The billionaire businessman and former prime minister, Bidzina Ivanishvili, has offered to finance the zoos move to a new location outside of the city, but there have also been calls for it to be scrapped altogether.

Svanidze Street in the citys Vake district was the first populated area to be hit by the flood. Here, the full force of the deluge hit homes built on cheap land next to the river 50 or so years ago. Absolutely nothing is left, says Murman Chanturashvili as he sorts pieces of broken furniture and sodden books into piles, ready to be removed by the soldiers and volunteers that are cleaning this area.
Chanturashvilis first-floor flat is caked with mud up to the ceiling and in places, the soaked parquet floor bulges underfoot. Fortunately, his wife was in Moscow at the time of the flood with their grandchildren. We were up to our necks in mud. Even the things I can wash down are useless now. Basically, everything was destroyed.
Not quite everything. Picking through the kitchen, Chanturashvili finds that his stash of homemade wine  sealed in plastic bottles and large glass jars in the cellar  are untouched. Smiling, he rinses the mud off one of the bottles with a hose outside and offers it as a present. Wine is a big deal in Georgia: a tangible link to their fertile land, their unique culture and their deep roots. Despite having to start almost from scratch, Chanturashvili is adamant that he wants to stay here.
What should I be afraid of? he asks. This house has been here for 40 years and nothing like this has happened before. Whoever thinks this place it at risk, let him think so! Our parents lived here and our children will be fine here too.
Poor urban-planning has turned Tbilisi into a city where further disaster is just waiting to happen

Experts, however, maintain that there are still significant risks. Geologist Claudio Margottini is a Unesco expert and vice-president of the International Consortium on Landslides. Since the flooding, he has been working with the Georgian Ministry of Environment Protection to assess the immediate risk to the city and develop a long-term plan of action.
Although the amount of rain that fell on the night of June 13 was rare, Margottini says that global climate change is making these extreme weather events more and more frequent. In the long-term, the city needs to develop a land-use plan taking into account maximum precipitation. This needs to be the basis of future town planning, in order to reduce the impact of these phenomena.
While officials are keen not to exaggerate the risks of future flooding, for many residents, poor urban-planning has turned Tbilisi into a city where further disaster is just waiting to happen.
Tamriko Kadagidze rushed to help when she saw the disaster unfold on Svanidze Street from her nearby apartment. In other parts of the city, theyre pulling down trees and cutting through cliffs to build apartment blocks, she says. If they keep doing this, the same kind of disaster could hit us again.

        <title>Making sense of Miami: what America's refuge city says about the US's future</title>

Just off Miamis busy Calle Ocho, the thoroughfare that is the beating cultural heart of the citys Cuban community, there rises a splendid ceiba tree whose roots erupt from the ground like waves from the sea, and whose vast branches throw shade far to either side.
All around the gnarled roots and tucked into the trees hidden crevices, one finds the offerings of the faithful: candles, bags of food, feathers, bones. In this modern metropolis, whose vaulting skyscrapers a mile away reflect the near-blinding sun, the saturnalia surrounding the ceiba attests to the lifeblood of the Afro-Cuban religion of santera, and Miamis eternal place in the imagination of el exilio, as the Cuban community is often referred to.
Ive lived in Miami off and on since the mid-1990s. As much as anywhere in the United States  my native country with which I have an often conflicted relationship  it counts as home. Landing back in Florida from Haiti, Paris or elsewhere, Miami always seems to offer the singular trick of providing some of the efficiency and convenience of living in the US while never seeming entirely a part of it.
Miami has long been a kind of quasi city-state that evokes strong reactions from visitors, especially those from more anglicised parts of the country who cannot make themselves understood in English to a large part of the local population  an experience that annoys and alarms them.
The strangest city in what is perhaps Americas strangest state, Miami is now home not just to Cubans but to thousands of Argentines, Brazilians, Colombians, Haitians, Jamaicans, Mexicans, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans and practically every other Latin American nationality, with sizeable populations of Russians, Indians, Persians and Orthodox Jews as well.

The city has become so micronised that what is commonly thought of as Miami in the popular imagination is, in fact, a series of semi-independent small cities  some only a few blocks long  within the urban sprawl of Miami-Dade County (population 2.6 million). It fronts a long sweep of the blue-green Atlantic to the east and finally peters out in the miasma of the Everglades swamp to the west and the necklace of the Florida Keys to the south.
A young city (it was only incorporated in 1896 in what was then mostly wilderness), Miami is often said to have been founded on bootleg liquor and built its skyline on an infusion of cocaine money in the 70s and 80s (at the height of its cocaine wars in 1980 to 1981, the city had the worlds highest murder rate). Nearly 30 years ago, the crime writer Edna Buchanan wrote that Miami had been a sleepy resort that had transformed to attract year-round ... concentrations of everything corrupt, bizarre or dangerous from everywhere in the world.
Above all, Miami is a place of exile where newcomers try to construct a new life. Upon arriving from Cuba in 1980, the author Reinaldo Arenas  who as a teenaged barbudo had fought with Castros forces but was then imprisoned and tortured both for being an independent intellectual and gay  declared Miami a barren and pestiferous peninsula ... trying to become for a million exiles, the dream of a tropical island.
No fan of the city, Arenas quickly decamped to New York, where he committed suicide in 1990. Miami, however, continued to percolate like a spoonful of Caf Bustelo coffee from the cafe colada that residents traditionally drink every afternoon at 3:05 (the citys area code). And it has become something more interesting than many had thought possible.

Now white-haired, bespectacled and elegant, Valladares spent 22 years in Cuban prisons for  among other perceived offences  refusing to put an Im with Fidel sign on his desk at the Ministry of Communications in 1960. Upon his release in 1982, he became a United States Ambassador to the United Nations. After residing in Washington for many years, he moved to Miami about 15 years ago.
The Cubans have demonstrated their ability and their quality of work here, Valladares says. Its a unique case in the history of the United States where the identity of a city was born, in a sense, in another country.
The Cuban aspects of Miamis identity appear to be far less monolithic than they once were, though. Many younger Cuban-Americans support the easing of relations with Cuba that US president Barack Obama has been pursuing with the islands rulers. Events such as the O Miami poetry festival bring Cuban cultural groups such as Omni Zona Franca (from eastern Havanas housing estates) to Miami on a regular basis, demonstrating that the citys Latin vibe is more than Hoy Como Ayer (Today Like Yesterday), as one long-standing club wistfully calls itself.

If Miami represents a refuge for Cubans, it serves as no less of one for Haitians who, fleeing a downward economic spiral and the tyranny of some of the countrys leaders, have made a profound impact on Miamis cultural life over the last several decades.
Along a once-neglected stretch of Northeast 2nd Avenue in the heart of the Haitian immigrant community, a cultural flowering has taken place that has seen the opening of the Little Haiti Cultural Center and its Caribbean Marketplace  a replica of the famed March en fer (Iron Market) in the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince . Exuberantly coloured murals by local artists adorn walls, and every Friday night the Rara Lakay band marches through the neighbourhood , beating on drums and blowing on plangent bamboo vaksin trumpets, whose bleat more evokes the deep Haitian countryside than an American city.
I have seen this city grow culturally, says the Haitian painter Edouard Duval Carri , who arrived in Miami from Paris in 1992. When I moved here it was really a [cultural] desert. That has changed.

Carri maintains his studio in Little Haiti. Famous for his painting of Haitian dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier in a wedding dress (an image that did not endear him to the regime), his space now seems a precursor of the areas renaissance. What was once a district many outsiders approached with trepidation now attracts hundreds of people to the outdoor concerts of its monthly Big Night in Little Haiti .
This is the doorway to the United States, Carri says. The particularity of Miami is that it has this very ebullient immigration that makes it quite fascinating.
But Miamis growth into the multicultural metropolis it is today has had a sinister side, too. In the 1960s, the city built the southern extension of Interstate 95 directly through the heart of the Overtown district, an area that had been a cultural mecca for black culture in the south. Overtown was a very pleasant place, says Enid Pinkney, the 83-year-old daughter of an immigrant from the Bahamas (one of the first non-indigenous communities to settle in Miami).
Dispersed to other areas of the city, black residents often found themselves met with hostility. After the 1980 acquittal of four white and Latino police officers for the murder of black businessman Arthur McDuffie, at least 18 people died in rioting and property destruction topped $100m. Fatal police shootings touched off riots in the city at three other points during that decade.
Police departments throughout the county gained a reputation for violence and corruption that intervening years have done little to diminish, with Miami Beach police famously fatally tasering teenage Colombian-American graffiti artist Israel Hernandez in 2013. That same year, a report by the US Justice Department found that City of Miami police had  engaged in a pattern or practice of excessive use of force through officer-involved shootings in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution and that the department was tainted by deficient tactics, improper actions by specialised units, as well as egregious delays and substantive deficiencies in deadly force investigations.

Outside observers often remain mystified by Miami. Three years ago, the author Tom Wolfe attempted to capture it as he had 1980s New York in The Bonfire of the Vanities , and instead spewed forth a right-wing caricature titled Back to Blood that showed no grasp of the place the city has become. Such misconceptions are helped along by gaffe- and scandal-prone local politicians, whose peccadillos include everything from floating the idea to shut down all the citys libraries to close a budget gap, to the by-now standard (for Miami) cash-for-favours schemes.
In some areas, things have gone over the top. In South Beach  once a slum for retirees and poor immigrants, now a gay mecca and nightlife hotspot  crass commercialisation has resulted in a kind of Vegas-by-the-sea ambiance, with even the famed Lincoln Road, once a redoubt of local restaurants and retailers, now housing little more than chain stores and the bewildered tourists they prey upon. The preponderance of juniors (a derisive term for the rich scions of Latin Americas economic elite) in the city can be somewhat off-putting, as it seems not only the language and music of that elite is being imported, but their class system, as well.
The city has blossomed and has a new cultural heritage
But the city has blossomed from the place that Reinaldo Arenas despised. The great Cuban poet and anthropologist Lydia Cabrera , who was during her lifetime one of the worlds foremost authorities on Afro-Cuban religion, spent the latter part of her life based in Miami, and donated her abundant collection of papers to the university here. It was home, too, for one of Haitis greatest poets, Flix Morisseau-Leroy , for the last 17 years of his life. And, as testament to the citys new cultural heritage, a new major institution, the Prez Art Museum Miami , opened next to the waters of Biscayne Bay in 2013; the Art Basel festival attracts thousands to the city every year; and the Miami Book Fair is an autumn staple of the literary calendar.
Perhaps more representative of the city than South Beach today are the northern reaches of Miami Beach, an area that is still home to many working-class residents despite spiralling property prices, where the lilting, almost Italianate sound of Argentine Spanish mixes with the caressing sounds of Brazilian Portuguese in the bodegas and on the beach. The Buenos Aires Bakery &amp; Cafe  an establishment on Collins Avenue, only steps away from the sea  sells a variety of pastries that would make any porteo misty-eyed with nostalgia as well as several different kinds of the leafy, highly caffeinated mate beloved in South America, and does a brisk business.

When one drives south towards the Florida Keys  where the last island, Key West, is a mere 90 miles from Cuba  the county begins to descend into farmland. It was here that, in the early part of the 20th century, a Latvian-born eccentric named Edward Leedskalnin created an extraordinary structure known as the Coral Castle , out of coral-formed limestone. As he worked alone and without advanced equipment, just how Leedskalnin created his castle remains something of a mystery  with explanations ranging from some secret mastery of the Earths magnetic field to telekinesis.
Today, other dreams are played out in Miami-Dades fields, and exist in the imaginings of the many migrant workers who toil here, scant miles from the glittering high-rises of downtown Miami. Surrounded by fields of squash, okra, beans and tomatoes, the community of Homestead, despite its tropical locale, evokes the somnolent Midwestern communities of a Ray Bradbury story. Low-rise buildings, train tracks and empty playground swings greet the visitor, and in the street one hears the melange of accents and dialects from the agricultural workers here: Mexican, Guatemalan, Haitian, Jamaican.
In the offices of the immigrant support group WeCount! just off of North Krome Avenue (which shares its name with one of the USs most infamous immigration detention centres located nearby), the connection between Homesteads rural lushness and the city rising only a few miles away seems obvious.
The Mexicans are the ones that put the food on Miamis table, says Catalina Santiago, an 18-year-old high school student who came to the US with her agricultural-worker parents from the Mexican state of Oaxaca a decade ago. But they are always spoken of in a condescending manner.
Related: Miami, the great world city, is drowning while the powers that be look away
On the street below, where Santiago sits with her brother and a number of other immigrants, dusk falls and Homestead sees Mexican families gathering for Sunday-night dinner at restaurants such as Casita Tejas. When they rise for work early the following morning, some will be met by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and local police, who will be waiting to check their immigration status and arrest them for probable deportation if they are undocumented (as many are, a state of affairs on which Floridas agriculture depends).
Perhaps it is impending apocalypse, natural and man-made, that makes Miamis frivolity all the more poignant. If climate change predictions are to be believed, large parts of Miami  Miami Beach, Key Biscayne, Virginia Key  will be under water in coming years, a phenomenon helped along by the fact that many Florida politicians, including Governor Rick Scott and the aforementioned Senator Rubio, deny that climate change can be linked to human activity.
Driving home north along US1, the skyline of Miami rises above the flat land, its concrete and steel wrapped in the warmth of the tropical sunset. A city of outsiders, refugees and immigrants that  in its reflection of present-day Americas diversity  feels in many ways more American than the 1950s small-town Americana that some politicians and commentators are perpetually nostalgic for.

I was born in Calcutta, but we moved to Bombay when I was one and a half years old, maybe in early 1964. The company my father worked in had relocated its head office in the face of growing labour unrest; the move was part of the general egress of industry from the city.
We continued to visit Calcutta once, sometimes twice, a year. My mothers brother lived there with his family in Pratapaditya Road, in the historic neighbourhood of Bhowanipore, South Calcutta. He is a Jadavpur University graduate and German-trained civil engineer. By the time I got to know him as a child, hed abandoned his job and set out with friends, establishing a factory that made machines in Howrah, Calcuttas industrial district across the river Hooghly. Given the political turbulence of the 1960s, the business was a long-drawn-out failure. My uncle, however, never wavered from his faith in the Left.
In 1977, the Left Front was elected to form the government in the state of West Bengal; it then won eight successive elections until finally being voted out of power in 2011. The tenure of the Left in West Bengal was marked by genuine achievements and plenty of failures. Perhaps one of its legacies was to create a microcosm that was entirely out of tune with the free-market zeitgeist whose vanguard assumed power in other parts of the world soon after the Left came to power in Bengal: one thinks of Margaret Thatchers election victory in 1979, and Ronald Reagans in 1981. India itself embraced free-market deregulation in 1991. Of course, theres no reason why Bengal shouldnt have explored an alternative path on its own terms; its just that actual faith in what these terms might be was, by the 80s, lacking.
I learnt two things from my visits to Calcutta in the 1960s and 70s, and to my uncles house in particular. The first was that there was an alternative to the corporate world I inhabited in Bombay. Culture did not have to be anglophone to be exciting or sophisticated. In fact in India at that time, it seemed sophistication and excitement often lay outside the realm of the anglophone. Second, it appeared that culture and learning did not have to be exclusive to privileged, stable or well-to-do lives. In my uncles house, the opposite seemed true: the energy I encountered in it as a child was a remnant of a cultural and political force-field that began to come into existence in the city in the 19th century.
My uncle's house contained an interior narrative whose echoes I'd discover later in other parts of the world

This house was the only piece of property my uncle owned, and it had been gifted to him by his father-in-law. My family came from Sylhet, now in Bangladesh, and theyd lost whatever land or property they might have owned with Partition. This was one of the reasons I never associated the sort of house of my uncle lived in with privilege. Also, Pratapaditya Road had become a slightly disturbed and down-at-heel area by the 1960s. Nevertheless, the house itself contained space and life, and an interior narrative whose echoes Id discover later in other parts of the world, but never their exact prototype.
These were the houses features: a porch on the ground floor; red oxidised stone floors; slatted Venetian or French-style windows painted green; round knockers on doors; horizontal wooden bars to lock doors; an open rooftop terrace; a long first-floor verandah with patterned cast-iron railings; intricately worked cornices; and ventilators the size of an open palm, carved as intricate perforations into walls. (Some houses built in the 1940s also incorporate perky art-deco elements: semi-circular balconies; a long, vertical strip comprising glass panes for the stairwell; porthole-shaped windows; and the famous sunrise motif on grilles and gates.)
My uncles house no longer stands. It came down as part of the property boom that happened in Calcutta in the 1990s, in anticipation of the Left Front governments resolve to bring industry to Bengal  a belated stirring of ambition arising from a desire not to miss out on the apparent benefits of economic deregulation that were transforming cities like Bombay, Delhi, Chennai and Bangalore. The destruction of these houses would also be a consequence of the house-owners inability to maintain property in an economically depressed city.
Industry never came, partly because of the complex issue of land acquisition as well as the insurmountable populism of West Bengals politics. But existing houses and neighbourhoods continued to be destroyed because of the ethos created by developers  a euphemism, often, for a new breed of land sharks. This ethos dictated that houses on prime land needed to be bought up and immediately destroyed for the price of the land they stood on. So the houses were never put on the market, and their market value was never determined.

Among the principal candidates for buying the new condos were non-resident Indians: Bengalis settled abroad, mainly in America. They never thought to purchase these houses to live in, though they would, of course, be open to buying such houses to inhabit in London, Marrakech or Goa. Family-owned houses that could no longer be maintained were, meanwhile, frequently sold to developers by non-resident Indians.
Soon, the near-simultaneous purchase and destruction of a house seemed like an inevitability. So, paradoxically, did the acquisition of the accoutrements of globalisation: industry and investment didnt come to Bengal, but the ancillary features of a deregulated economy  shopping malls, new five-star hotels, multiplexes, gated properties  began to adorn Calcutta.
These days, the prices of new properties here are fuelled mainly by speculation. This means that new housing is hardly a response to demand; its an invitation to investors whod previously have put their money in equity. Advertisements are a reliable integer of the desires of the new well-to-do: in Calcutta (officially Kolkata since 2001), adverts for gold jewellery  an attractive form of investment  are ubiquitous. Yet in the last 10 years, Id hazard a guess that these have been overtaken by adverts for apartments in tower blocks and improbably named (Highland Park, Diamond City ) gated enclaves. Rival newspapers carry full-page ads for the same construction on their front pages. Until 2013, property seemed a less volatile form of investment than the market.
But property prices in Calcutta have now reached a plateau, and the only people making money off new flats are developers and estate agents. In fact, they seem to be almost the only people making money in Calcutta at all. A newspaper report revealed two months ago that there has been a dramatic and counter-intuitive surge in dollar multimillionaires in this city. The report noted that nearly all of them were making money in real estate.

It was during my travels in Europe in the last 20 years that I realised the neighbourhoods we confront there not only represent the history that produced them, but a history involving communities resisting their disappearance . Without such resistance, no vestiges of the great urban churning of the last two centuries would remain in the world today  in Europe, Australia, the United States and even Latin America. Calcutta, too, was powerfully and uniquely a part of this urban churning (I say uniquely because the neighbourhoods and type of house Ive described above have echoes, but no counterpart, in any other city  in India or abroad).
When we speak of Calcuttas architecture, we usually mean the colonial institutions that the British erected, or the aristocratic mansions of North Calcutta (once called the Black Town by the English) built by Bengali landowners. But the houses Im speaking of were built by anonymous builders for middle-class Bengali professionals: lawyers, doctors, civil servants and professors. Theyre to be found throughout the city, from north to south, in Bhowanipore, Sarat Bose Road, Lake Road, Southern Avenue, Hindustan Park, Bakul Bagan, Paddapukur, Kidderpore, Ahiritola and more.
They all possess the family resemblances Ive enumerated above, to do with slatted windows, cornices, open rooftops and red floors. What is remarkable, though, is that no two houses are identical: a house with a broad facade might stand next to a thin house, both sharing various characteristics  and there are many other ways in which each house you encounter is a fresh conjuring-up or experiment. This makes for an unprecedented, sui generis variety in a single lane or neighbourhood; a variety I have seen nowhere else (think, in contrast, of the identical Victorian houses on a London street). And the style  which can only be described as Bengali-European  is neither renaissance (hardly any Corinthian pillars, as you might spot in the North Calcutta villas) nor neo-Gothic (as Bombays colonial buildings are) nor Indo-Saracenic, which expresses a utopian idea of what a mish-mash of Renaissance, Hindu and Moghul features might be. Its a style that is, to use Amartya Sen s word, eccentric and beautiful, and entirely the Bengali middle classs.

Old is a misnomer for these buildings: theyre the products of the new Calcutta, the Calcutta of modernity and modernism that arose in the 19th century and took on a new identity in the 20th; a Calcutta that evaded, became a counterpoint to, took from, and was far richer than both the British-created city and any idea of the Black Town.
In a way, many of these buildings, which came up from the early 20th-century onwards, testify to why Calcutta continued to be a political, and especially a cultural, hub in India long after the British took away its status as capital city to contain its revolutionary nationalism in 1911  and even a century after the Renaissance, the efflorescence in Bengali culture in the middle of the 19th century. Its this Calcutta whose buildings are poised to vanish, and whose survival some of us are arguing for. Two letters were sent in May to the chief-minister of West Bengal: one signed by 15 people who cut across party lines and persuasions; the other by Amartya Sen, addressed to me and written in support of the project.
Among the ideas that have been put to the government is that of transfer of development rights  which would see a house-owner sell the developer rights equivalent to the price of the land on which his or her house stands, which could then be used by the developer to extend constructions to a commensurate value in another location. Whether or not this model will work cannot be ascertained unless its adopted.
The letter also refers to the MIT economist Esther Duflos observation  glaringly obvious to the outsider who knows a bit about Calcuttas cultural history, but perhaps not so to the resident who is inured to their city  that, properly showcased, these neighbourhoods (Duflo compares them to Pragues) could make Calcutta a tourist destination, and bring it the revenue it so badly needs. The ensuing danger of gentrification is a real one, but a fine line divides it from genuine cultural reinvention.
The basic aims of our campaign are these: first, to work towards and arrive at a working solution, however improbable this seems; second, to find new ways of looking at, and discussing whats important about, these houses and neighbourhoods. Although it would appear that the problem needs to be addressed primarily by the heritage commissions in the city, its also clear that heritage, as a notion and definition, is part of the problem.
In Calcutta, 'heritage' means we cease to engage with the architectural individuality and difference of buildings

In Calcutta, a heritage building is a landmark that is important for either being a significant institutional building, or because a famous person frequented it or lived there. The architectural distinctiveness of the building is a secondary concern, or is a pre-ordained, generic feature of the structure: that is, we already know it qualifies as a heritage structure because it adheres to our idea of what a heritage colonial building looks like.
In Calcutta, heritage means we cease to engage with the architectural individuality and difference of buildings and precincts. We dont periodise, falling back on catch-all terms like colonial; or historicise; or describe; or define. Simply put, heritage means we dont see, or think about, buildings. (And yet, even as a rubric to be blindly followed, heritage is ignored astonishingly in Calcutta: iconic peoples houses are unmarked and repeatedly destroyed; grade-A listed structures are torn down.)
In July, Mamata Banerjee, the chief-minister of West Bengal, whose government succeeded the Left Fronts in 2011, will make her first trip to London. It will be an intriguing event, as Ms Banerjees fascination with the British capital is well-known, and has caused mirth in the past. On assuming power, one of her first startling remarks had to do with her desire to turn Calcutta into London. She clarified later that what she meant was that both cities had grown alongside rivers, and that Calcutta could do much more with its riverfront.
If she studies her surroundings on this trip, shell discover that Calcutta doesnt actually look very much like London. The main reason has to do with the two cities notably different architectural styles: Londons elegant Victorian, Gothic, Georgian and Edwardian buildings (jealously protected from destruction, on the whole, by conservation laws) are shaped by a distinct Puritanism very unlike the slatted, openness-loving, loiterer-friendly Bengali-European style of, say, Bhowanipore. This disjunction is another reminder of why Calcuttas neighbourhoods cant be reduced to colonial history, and must be understood in terms of their own peculiar, cross-referencing cosmopolitanism.
Related: The Writers' Building, Kolkata: a history of cities in 50 buildings, day 13
To move on this matter hasnt been easy, and not only because of governmental inaction and the absence of actual powers where the West Bengal Heritage Commission and the Kolkata Municipal Corporations Heritage Committee are concerned. Whats more difficult is peoples inability to recognise the architectural legacy theyve taken for granted for more than a century, and their mysterious disconnect from the history that produced these neighbourhoods.
This is the reason I provided the short personal note at the beginning: to explain my outsiders point of view. It may be why I see these buildings as I do, without that special Bengali nostalgia that expresses itself, generically, in songs by Bangla bands and in recent Bengali films, which occasionally conflate North Calcutta and any one of its decaying mansions with a sentimental idea of the citys true heritage. Theres a certain quietism, a sweet apathy, in such nostalgia that I feel even more distant from than the moral superiority Ive had to confront from people who feel this architecture is too minor and remote an issue for intelligent people to be concerned with.
Whats at stake here is a discussion on urban regeneration  which is connected to, but distinct from, economic revival. For the urban revival of any city, its a prerequisite that citizens engage with the spaces, buildings and histories that characterise it, rather than deny those features; that they understand and reuse them. Calcutta, in the last two decades, has largely failed to do this. But the narrative of every great city must contain such episodes of failure, before it begins to look at itself anew.

From Waze for crowds to Uber for street food  MIT innovations at Kumbh Mela
For the spiritual among the 30 million people descending on the Indian city of Nashik for this Augusts tri-annual Hindu festival, the event is a catharsis. For urban planners it is an opportunity to analyse city problems on a huge scale

This August an expected 30 million religious devotees, ascetics and tourists will congregate in the Indian city of Nashik for the Kumbh Mela  a 20-day Hindu festival which is one of the largest public gatherings in the world.
The mass pilgrimage of faith takes place every three years on a rotational basis in four alternating cities, and will be returning to Nashik after a gap of 12 years. For the spiritual, the event is a catharsis, where one can purge oneself of sin by taking a dip in the holy water of the sacred rivers. But for technologists, social innovators and urban planners, the staggering increase in human density is a golden opportunity to identify, analyse and study pop-up city problems at scale.
Ramesh Raskar, who spearheads the Massachusetts Institute of Technologys Kumbhathon venture, is head of MITs Camera Culture group, conducting multidisciplinary research in optics, sensors, probes and software processing. The Kumbhathon was conceived as a sandbox initiative to create a prototype ecosystem with the broader vision of game-changing innovation at its core, he explains. The challenges of the 2015 Kumbh Nashik will be mapped to help address similar issues in refugee camps, concerts such as Burning Man in the Nevada desert and in emerging cities across the world.
The Kumbhathon project is at the vanguard of tradition and technology
Ramesh Raskar, MIT
Raskar worked with local innovators, students, city officials, civic groups, the police and historians in his hometown of Nashik to draw up a shortlist of key concerns, from a list of more than 500 issues received through an open crowdsourced platform, for the team to address. The project is at the vanguard of tradition and technology, said Raskar.
Over the past year, the Kumbhathon team has held three-monthly workshops and innovation camps to discuss, test and implement a range of smart solutions  from the hi-tech to the decidedly low-tech  to address challenges in the areas of access to healthcare, transportation, food and sanitation, housing and crowd control.

One hi-tech idea is an app to manage crowds and avoid stampedes  a regular problem at the festival, with at least 39 people killed in a stampede in 2003, the last time Nashik was host city. Modelled on the lines of the worlds largest community-based real time traffic and navigation app, Waze, the app uses mobile phone location data to help local police redirect pedestrians away from saturated areas.
Meanwhile, an online platform, LiveNashik, will dynamically gather and analyse data on taxis, train and bus schedules, free rooms in hostels, and the availability of hospital beds, ambulances and blood stocks. Within that citywide project, a person tracking app, called Milap, aims to address the major problem of children and others being lost during the frenzy of the festival. Under the scheme, individuals can be registered at entry points via a barcode that serves as an identification tool. If someone is lost, they can visit a store, where the shopkeeper can read their barcode with a smartphone  and a match with the missing persons database can be made.
Other hi-tech initiatives include the Epidemic Tracker, which is a combination of a mobile app and cloud-based backend analytical engine to monitor the health of festival attendees in real time. Not only does this serve as a check on potential outbreaks of disease, but also helps medics offer relevant prescriptions and medication.
However well constructed the technology, it depends on what society is ready to absorb and embrace
Tarun Khanna, Harvard
Another challenge being tackled is food distribution, where the team has devised an Uber -like logistical network that connects festival-goers with quality and hygienic food suppliers. This enables customers to have access to information about when and where the food was cooked and make more informed decisions about consumption. According to the Kumbhathon team, this model could be expanded into a multibillion-dollar nationwide service.
Its about tapping into smart citizens to make smart cities, said Raskar. Citizens watch more TV, carry smartphones and are highly mobile and connected. Their participation is crucial.

The ability of low-tech innovations to bring about greater social impact has been an eye-opening experience for the team. WikiNasik, is one such example, where more than 300 volunteers worked to update Nashiks Wikipedia page, so that outsiders had access to up-to-date and comprehensive information about the city. Students took cameras and used pictures to document the heritage and history of the city, said Raskar. Personal compilations can help enhance the experience for visitors and can also add value in the tourism sector in building an extensive city guide for the future, he added.
Another low-tech solution with high social outcome is a Shops Online portal that displays detailed information about retailers in the city. From specifics on the owner, the nature of the business and the hours of operation, to the location and a profile of the surrounding area, the platform could open up wide-ranging data-mining possibilities. The repository of data is key for potential investors who want to start a business during the Kumbh Mela.

While citizen participation on the ground in Nashik has been significant, the correlation between technology and the public acceptance of that technology must be kept in mind, according to Tarun Khanna, director of the South Asia Institute at Harvard University. As part of a team mapping the Allahabad Kumbh in 2013, he was surprised to find that a person-tracking app using photos wasnt as effective as the age-old solution of setting off a balloon in the air when a person was lost. However well constructed the technology, it all depends on what society is ready to absorb and embrace, he said.
Rahul Mehrotra, chair of the Urban Planning and Design department at Harvard, who led the venture for the Allahabad Kumbh, said that technology should not be considered a fix in itself. Cities are broader, more sensitive and more complex ecosystems in which technology is just one instrument and cannot be treated as an end in itself, he said.

If a city could embody a rainbow, it would be San Francisco . It is home both to the LGBT pride flag  which was first used in the citys 1978 Gay Freedom Day Parade  and a wealth of architecture and street art in multicolour.
For photographer Kristen Simar ( @home_schooling ), the character of the city is bound up with this multitude of colours. San Franciscos lifeblood is in its neighbourhoods. Each colourful house is a celebration of the citys history and the people who have chosen to call San Francisco home. No two houses are the same and each story is unique.
As the closest major city to Silicon Valley, the city has become the urban home of the tech scene, bringing with it a significant dose of gentrification  and change . San Francisco, historically home to trailblazing movements, has become a city of wealth, which has forced out many who cant keep up financially, including artists and activists. The old quirkiness and character is slowly being washed away, Kristen explains. Im trying to capture every bit of beauty, colour and individuality while its still there.

After more than a year of imprisonment , two Ethiopian women had no idea they were about to be released until a prison loudspeaker informed them they were free to go.
They were kind of stunned. Can you imagine what kind of emotion? They didnt believe it at first  they thought they were being taken somewhere else, said a friend of Edom Kassaye , the freelance journalist who was released from Kality jail on Thursday morning along with another detainee, the Zone 9 blogger Mahlet Fantahun .
Their release followed that of three others from the Zone 9 case on Wednesday after prosecutors dropped terrorism-related charges against five of the 10 suspects. The trial has attracted widespread condemnation, with human-rights advocates and western governments arguing the writers were persecuted solely for criticising an intolerant government.
The government should show this is only a first step toward releasing all political prisoners and opening up space for Ethiopians to voice dissent on a range of issues, said Leslie Lefkow, deputy director of the Africa division at Human Rights Watch, adding that the suspects shouldnt have been imprisoned in the first place.
Many Ethiopian Facebook users believe the sudden concession is related to this months visit of President Barack Obama, the first to Africas second most populous country by a sitting US leader. While the US values its relationship with Ethiopia from a security perspective, praising the countrys development record, it also routinely criticises the governments repression of civil rights.
It is funny how dictators are more accountable to Americans than to their own people and constitution, wrote Kassahun Addis, an exiled journalist, in a Facebook post . This looks like a pre-emptive charm offensive by the US and Ethiopian governments.
The charges alleged the group of critical bloggers and journalists had been plotting against the government with foreign organisations.
Redwan Hussien, a government spokesman, put the releases down to magnanimity  an official recognition that the five writers released were only accomplices to the conspiracy. The trial against the rest would continue, he said.
But Ameha Mekonnen, a defence lawyer for the suspects, countered on Thursday: All were charged as principle offenders. Theres no distinction among them.
The pardoning of convicts occurs regularly in Ethiopia. Two Swedish journalists were shown clemency in 2012 after being jailed for supporting a rebel group in the Ogaden region of Ethiopia with which they became embedded.
Birtukan Mideksa, meanwhile, the opposition leader who  in a case that attracted widespread condemnation  was twice jailed by the government , was also pardoned eventually.
Over the course of court proceedings that have so far lasted more than a year, the state has failed to present any evidence of terrorism-related activity on the part of the bloggers and journalists. The prosecution case amounted to calling witnesses who had observed police making raids and confiscating evidence, such as laptops, in April 2014.
There was no witness who was there to say, I saw this or that person being involved in this or that crime, said Ameha.
Judges will decide at the next hearing, on 20 July  a week before Obamas visit  whether the remaining suspects have to defend themselves or are acquitted, Ameha said.
The idea that dropping the charges was politically calculated in advance of Obamas visit was strengthened by the release on Thursday of another journalist, Reeyot Alemu. She headed home after serving around four years of a sentence that was reduce to five years from 14 on appeal in Aug. 2012.
Reeyot had been imprisoned for plotting against the government after working with the US-based opposition website Ethiopian Review and writing articles critical of the government in local newspapers.
Redwan said it is standard practice to release prisoners early. But an an acquaintance of the jailed journalists and bloggers, who wished to remain anonymous, suggested Reeyot had been told she would serve her full sentence after refusing to apologise for crimes she denied committing.
Another factor in the decisions may have been that Ethiopia is hosting a critical UN financing for development conference next week. Global leaders will gather in Addis Ababa to try and agree on how to finance the ambitious sustainable development goals, which will set the international development agenda for the next 15 years.
Ethiopian officials will be eager to deflect attention away from the jailed bloggers and towards the countrys record of economic growth and poverty reduction. The government will hope that donors who already deem Ethiopia worthy of development assistance will support a plan for carbon-neutral industrialisation by 2030.

South Sudanese refugees in Uganda receive generous welcome
Four years after South Sudan became independent on 9 July 2011, conflict has forced tens of thousands across the border into Uganda, where they are given assistance and encouraged to abandon any ethnic animosity

When fighting broke out in December 2013 in South Sudans capital, Juba, it spread rapidly toward the countrys north-east  directly towards John Aleus home. He wanted no part of the conflict and hoped the remoteness of his village in northern Jonglei state would insulate him.
But in September last year, a group of fighters came to steal his cattle. As he tried to spur the animals to flee, he was shot in the foot. It took his neighbours three days to carry him to the nearest hospital. His foot was saved, but he will never be able to walk without crutches again.
By April he was well enough to travel, so together with his family he journeyed across the border to Uganda . If Im going back, I cant feed my family, he said. Im in need of something that can promote my life and my familys life.
More than 150,000 South Sudanese have fled to Uganda since the fighting started, in part because the Ugandan government has one of the most generous refugee policies in the world. Once registered, new arrivals can move to permanent settlements  where they are given their own plot of land  rather than refugee camps. UN agencies provide food and resources to build a house. Schools and health centres are positioned nearby and refugees are encouraged to find jobs.
They have all the rights that are attributed to any human being, irrespective of their status as refugees, said Titus Jogo, the governments refugee desk officer for Adjumani district in northern Uganda, where Aleu is now living.
It is all available to Aleu, but with one condition: he must abandon any ethnic animosity he still harbours.
Related: South Sudanese refugees struggle to adjust to life in Uganda  in pictures
South Sudans ongoing conflict grew out of a political dispute between President Salva Kiir and his former deputy, Riek Machar. Aleu accused Machars supporters of introducing an ethnic dimension, pitting the former deputys Nuer tribe against Kiirs Dinka group, of which Aleu is a member. He believes he was deliberately targeted by Nuer fighters. Machars supporters have made similar allegations. And the UN has reported ethnically targeted killings and rapes by both sides.
But Jogo said the Ugandan government will not tolerate any ethnically motivated violence. We openly told them that we are receiving them as refugees from South Sudan in spite of their differences, he said. We want them to live together and forget whatever happened to them.
It is really the only option, because the government does not have the logistical capacity to sort people into sites based on ethnicity. And it has worked well, Jogo said. I would actually like to invite Kiir and Machar to come to Adjumani to see how well they can live together.
The Alere resettlement site outside Adjumani, now more than two decades old, has been housing South Sudanese refugees longer than the country has existed. Members of more than a dozen South Sudanese tribes live in squat, circular mud huts that dot the hilly landscape.
Peter Mamer Ayom settled in Alere in 2012 after a series of cattle raids in his village outside Bor, the Jonglei state capital. He was recently appointed as a community development worker, which means he is responsible for circulating within the community and sorting out any conflicts that arise. He said the refugees  including 800 recent arrivals  take the mandate to avoid ethnic tensions seriously.
Were not thinking about all the fighting, which is happening from South Sudan, he said. We left all those things behind. The only conflict he is concerned about is with the local community. There have been complaints from people living near the settlement sites that the South Sudanese are receiving unfair advantages.
Though he is from Uganda, Johnson Emerson worked at a restaurant in South Sudan. He fled along with the refugees when the war started  and though he has access to the same markets and health centres, he still believes they should not be welcomed unless local Ugandans are given all the same services.

Despite some conflict between the two communities, Ayom said tensions have eased in recent months, allowing refugees to focus on building new lives  a process that diverts any energy they might spend on nursing grudges. While they are allowed to work, he said it is difficult to find jobs, which leaves refugees dependent on the monthly food rations distributed by the World Food Programme.
Alongside the refugees from South Sudan, WFP is also supporting people displaced from Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. At $5.5m (357m) a month, it is the most expensive response in Ugandas history according to acting country director Michael Dunford. In December, the agency was even briefly forced to cut rations when funding ran low, though Dunford said there is no current shortage.
But the WFPs work looks set to increase. Fighting continues in South Sudan, and almost 5 million people are facing acute food insecurity , which would result in more refugees heading for the border. Both Dunford and Jogo said they were prepared to welcome anybody who wants to come.

Ukraine crisis needs a political solution to reinforce EU aid efforts
Though the EU has doubled its aid budget for Ukraine, where 1.5 million people have received vital humanitarian assistance, the conflict is blighting their future

There is a humanitarian crisis right on the doorstep of the EU. More than 2.2 million people have been forced to leave their homes because of the fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. As many as 900,000 have sought refuge in neighbouring countries.
Last week, I visited eastern Ukraine for the second time this year to see for myself the impact of our humanitarian aid programmes on the lives of those affected, and to discuss the challenges ahead.
One example of how the EU is helping vulnerable people in the crisis is through a cash-and-vouchers programme. While these schemes may be less visible than aid convoys, they can be far more efficient in responding to individual needs. In Kramatorsk, I met Julia, whose third child was born just a few months ago. Julia was forced to leave her home due to the conflict, and her husband has lost his job.
The cash-and-vouchers scheme helps Julia to support her family, enabling her to buy food and to access clean water. Yet because of the ongoing fighting and road blockades, she cannot visit other relatives such as her grandmother, who lives in her hometown and also needs assistance.
Hers was just one of the stories of personal struggle from the 5 million people estimated to be in need of assistance, according to the UNHCR, the UN refugee agency. Nearly two-thirds of them are particularly vulnerable, including children, the elderly and the disabled.
So far, EU humanitarian aid has reached 1.5 million people thanks to great teamwork with our international partners. Most of those who have been helped are among the most vulnerable. But their ordeal is not over. Their lives are still blighted by uncertainty. On 1 July, the commission therefore decided to double its 2015 humanitarian budget for Ukraine by committing a further 15m (10m) .
We will also launch a project under our EU children of peace programme to address the trauma of thousands of children in eastern Ukraine. All in all, the EU has provided more than 223m in immediate assistance to civilians affected by the conflict on both sides since early 2014.
But more needs to be done. A UN appeal at the beginning of this year is so far only 35% funded . The international community needs to step up its assistance, and aid must be strictly needs-based, without any political agendas attached. That is how we can ensure that we reach the most vulnerable, regardless of the area they reside in. We are particularly concerned about the humanitarian situation in non-government controlled areas.
The EU is providing assistance on both sides of the conflict line, and to refugees in neighbouring countries, including Belarus and Russia. Despite the ceasefire agreed in Minsk in February , fighting continues.
The staff of EU-funded humanitarian organisations have come under fire while distributing assistance. This is unacceptable: our aid is always provided on the basis of humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence.
The access to the non-government controlled areas in Ukraines Donbas is now more restricted, cutting people off from desperately needed assistance. This is why I reiterate my call on both sides to refrain from further fighting and to ensure unfettered and speedy access for internationally recognised humanitarian organisations. During consultations with the government, I received assurances that they will address our concerns about access across the frontlines.
More than 1.3 million people have been displaced from the conflict areas in Donbass and Crimea. During my visit, I spoke to some of them and heard of their hopes. Many were receiving humanitarian aid but they needed support beyond emergency assistance to find houses, jobs, schools for their children and to access healthcare. We must look at how we can best support them together with the Ukrainian government.
Solidarity is one of the cornerstones of the EU. Our humanitarian assistance demonstrates that we stand by the most vulnerable people affected by the conflict in Ukraine. Yet, as we know too well, humanitarian problems cannot have solely humanitarian solutions.
This is why the EU is also deeply engaged in supporting the implementation of the Minsk agreements with a view to bringing about a sustainable solution that respects Ukraines territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence as well as international law. We need a political solution and it must come urgently.

Failure to find political solutions in areas of violent crisis is forcing ICRC to extend its core humanitarian remit, says organisations president Peter Maurer

The worlds inability to deal with the proliferation of conflict driven-crises is forcing the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to shoulder an ever-larger burden and reassess the way it works, the organisations president has warned.
Peter Maurer said the operational budget of the worlds oldest humanitarian organisation had risen by almost 50% over the past three years as it tried to keep pace with an extraordinary period of enduring humanitarian emergencies.
He said the failure to find political solutions to the ongoing violent crises in areas including the Middle East , sub-Saharan Africa and Ukraine had left the ICRC spending more than 1.5bn Swiss francs (1bn) a year as it  and other humanitarian organisations  tried to plug the gaps in the global response.
The international system is having difficulty getting to grips with those conflicts; countries have difficulty moving to consensus on how to deal with those crises, he said.
That seems to open spaces for disorder and conflict and we have those dynamics  which may be distinct and different in each and every country  but together they nevertheless refer us to an international system that does not seem to have international institutions with the ability to negotiate solutions to conflicts or to the big, increasing and accelerating impact of crises. Basically, it increases the necessity for us to respond.
Maurer pointed to Syria  which moved from internal civil unrest to a proxy war involving regional and global powers over the course of three-and-a-half years  as an example of the striking absence of political progress.
Isnt it a bit of a symbol that high-quality negotiators have not been able to move anything significant in the Syrian context? he said.
We had Kofi Annan and Lakhdar Brahimi and now we have Staffan de Mistura at the present moment, and they have tried bottom-down, top-up approaches, combinations of top-down and bottom-up; they have tried quiet, they have tried public; they have tried pressure, they have tried good will, and somehow there doesnt seem to be any political process that will turn the tide.
That lack of progress, he said, had left the ICRC and others scrabbling around for as big a plug as possible to try to contain a regional humanitarian crisis. Elsewhere  in rural Afghanistan , Ukraines Donbass region, Lake Chad , northern Nigeria and southern Niger  he said the organisation was in a very lonely situation as it operates where few do because of the difficulties of negotiating access.
Even the provision of medical assistance, which had previously been uncontroversial and accepted, was proving increasingly difficult in conflicts involving many different parties and against a backdrop of rising attacks on medical staff and facilities.
Maurer said the volume, complexity and duration of the current emergencies was forcing the ICRC to re-examine the mechanics and aims of its responses.
We still have a strong commitment to our original mission, which is to protect and assist people who are suffering from the impact of violence, but the violence has changed its character, format and pattern so that we are now responding year after year, he said.
I think we are challenged in how we define humanitarian action today and how we relate to long-term needs. We are also confronted with legitimate expectations from the people who want us to respond far more thoroughly to their basic pleas than we would have done in a much more contained form of conflict.
Maurer said that a recent trip to Maiduguri , the northeastern Nigerian city at the heart of the Boko Haram Islamist insurgency, had also led him to consider whether the ICRC should extend its core humanitarian remit to include the provision or facilitation of education.
I saw 500,000 displaced persons  a lot of them kids, he said. For the second year running, they are not going to school and they are in camps where there are no educational facilities. Each day that passes without kids being able to go to school is an enormous burden on the future.
Given that the ICRC are the only ones there and could not help with schooling, said Maurer, perhaps the time had come to try working with others in an attempt to ensure a basic level of education.
We may not do it ourselves, but if we cant provide some structure for an organisation to come and do it, they wont come, he said. And if they dont come, we will have to do it ourselves or we will fail. Its a completely different humanitarian need. Maybe we will have to slowly walk our way into that territory without necessarily already knowing how we do it from one conflict to another.
Maurer said he was acutely aware that a move into education could jeopardise the ICRCs much-valued reputation for neutrality. Boko Harams name means western education is forbidden.
We will certainly have to do a sober assessment in order to retain what is critical for our basic operation. I wouldnt immediately give up and say, This is just much too political and we will never do it, or we will never have a partnership with someone who does it.
It was, he added, one of the many dilemmas now facing humanitarian organisations at a time when a record 59.5 million people have been forced from their homes by war, violence and persecution .
While conflicts have expanded and deepened and transformed, actors have transformed and humanitarian assistance is transforming, he said. Protection work is transforming and taking on another character.

Britains Department for International Development (DfID) has broadly succeeded in implementing a new law measuring the impact of its overseas aid on reducing gender inequality, establishing a lead on integrating gender into humanitarian efforts that other international donors should follow, according to a report .
The study, by the Great Initiative and Plan UK , analysed information drawn from 44 projects  a mixture of business cases for development aid and approved humanitarian assistance  since the International Development (Gender Equality) Act came into effect in May last year.
The act places a duty on the government to consider ways in which development and humanitarian funding will build gender equality in the countries receiving aid.

The report praised DfID for engaging in a meaningful way with the act and going beyond its legal obligations. It urged the British government to encourage other countries to make a similar binding commitment.
DfID is broadly compliant with the procedures it has defined for implementing the act  namely a clearly flagged statement in the business case outlining the impact on gender inequality, the report, which was launched on Tuesday, said.
The study advocated several improvements, suggesting that DfID should: focus on ensuring that all business cases have a clearly flagged statement of gender impact; increase the quality of gender analysis by, for instance, sharing good practice from gender-sensitive and gender-transformative programmes; and address issues of transparency.
The report also urged DfID to maintain a high level of political leadership and step up global advocacy around the act.
We were delighted to find that the act has both driven, and joined forces with, other measures to promote gender equality. At the time of our analysis (May 2015) 64% of the business cases in our sample contained a clear statement addressing gender impact and only 18% of business cases lacked this statement, the report said.
DfID had since explained why some cases lacked statements, the report said. Most of the gaps were due to political or commercial sensitivity, while two of the absent statements were in the process of being published.
However, the reports authors noted that transparency was still an issue.
DFID has some progress to make on transparency. Accessing information can be a challenge, it said, adding that this fell short of DfIDs commitments under the UK Aid Transparency Guarantee.
Another problem raised by the reports authors lay in ensuring gender analyses, carried out during project planning, were implemented in delivery.
DfID has had a strong initial focus on compliance, as we would expect in the first year since the act was passed, so there is little evidence yet available about the expectation on programme staff  and even less on delivery partners  to ensure a gender focus is maintained through programme delivery.
Launching the report, Mariella Frostrup, a founding trustee of the Great Initiative, said independent evaluations were important to shore up public support for UK aid.
Related: Gender equality is a founding value of the EU, so why the lack of progress? | Joanna Maycock
She highlighted one case study from the report  the DfID-funded upgrading and resurfacing of a road in western Uganda  as an example of the importance of a gender perspective. The project was scored as low relevance to gender because promoting equality was not its primary objective.
But it surprised us, and indeed it turned out to be one of the most transformative projects we found in our evaluation. It identifies womens land ownership, violence against women, womens employment and social norms and stereotypes as issues to be addressed. And it mandates that 25% of jobs on the project are reserved for women, that womens safety and security is guaranteed and that gender sensitisation and awareness projects are run alongside the actual construction, she said.
Projects like this give me hope that we can eliminate gender inequality, but only if we recognise it, and tackle it wherever and whenever we can. That is what the act mandates us to do.
Gender was already a priority for DfID before the passage of the act, the report said. In a June interview with the Guardian , Justine Greening, the international development secretary, described DfIDs focus on women and girls as relentless.
Greening said she was determined to continue the departments work on tackling female genital mutilation and child marriage over the next parliament  and in the negotiations over the sustainable development goals , which will replace the millennium development goals later this year.
A DfID spokesperson said the act had given extra ambition and focus to the departments efforts to improve the rights and wellbeing of girls and women.
The report makes clear that DfID has gone above and beyond the act and we will continue to push other countries to follow our lead, the spokesperson said.
Tanya Barron , chief executive of Plan UK, said in a statement that the report showed what could be achieved when gender equality became a mandatory consideration, not an optional tick box.
She urged the EU, the World Bank and the UN system to replicate what the UK had done, especially in this critical year when the development agenda for the next 15 years is being fine-tuned.
The stakes have never been higher, as the sustainable development goals , financing for development and climate change talks set the worlds course for the foreseeable future. This report provides the evidence we need to argue that gender should be at the heart of these agreements.

There is a strange pattern to interviews in Tanzania . People on the verge of offering information stop mid-flow, pause, and then say something along the lines of: I dont have the data or information on that.
It appears odd until you look at the bills that have been rushed through parliament in recent weeks, which activists and journalists say could turn Tanzania into one of Africas most repressive countries for freedom of speech.

Its not a coincidence. This is the year of elections, says Maria Sarungi Tsehai , founder of Change Tanzania, a social media citizen movement. The organisation campaigns against laws that threaten independent reporting and dissident voices in the lead-up to Octobers presidential and parliamentary elections.
A Cybercrimes Act , signed into law on 8 May, criminalises the sharing of information deemed false, deceptive, misleading or inaccurate, forces internet service and mobile phone providers to share users information without telling them, and allows police officers to search and seize equipment without much justification.
Maxence Melo, co-founder of JamiiForums  a news and social networking platform that has become Tanzanias top whistleblowing site  is extremely worried about the laws. Since the site was founded in 2006, he has been questioned 17 times, detained twice, received death threats and suffered a mysterious car accident.
But he has refused to divulge the sources of information posted online. In 2007, Jamii published details of a corrupt energy deal  known as the Richmond scandal  which led to the dissolution of the cabinet and resignation of the prime minister. The expos also brought Melos first arrest and interrogation.
Another energy scandal exposed by Jamii and subsequently picked up by newspapers led to further senior sackings and donor distrust in the shape of threats to withhold almost $500m (324.5m) in aid.
More trouble followed for Melo. They used to say: We are going to come with a law that will force you to give us whatever document [or] details we need, he says.
Diplomats and journalists have dubbed the Cybercrimes Act the Jamii bill. Some MPs have told Melo not to make a fuss about it until after the elections, saying it might be amended later.
After elections in 2011, Melo says, Jamii was made an enemy of the state by President Jakaya Kikwete, who publicly blamed the site for a 20% drop in voter support from 2007. On the other hand, opposition politicians  some of whom have had their dirty laundry aired  have accused Jamii of working for the government.
The deputy communications minister, January Makamba  who hopes to run for the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party this year, when Kikwete steps down after his second term  accused Jamii of favouring the opposition in the last ballot.
The fact that theyve been trying to shroud bills that are openly trying to curb the freedom of expression is ridiculous
Maria Sarungi Tsehai
Makamba says the Cybercrimes Act was not meant to prevent the exchange and drafting of information but to protect people from abuse, such as online fraud and bullying. Tanzania is one of the freest countries in Africa , he insists.
That diplomats are unable to find the final text of laws that have been passed is embarrassing for them, says Makamba, adding that the fact activists are struggling to see the drafts of others speaks volumes about their level of interest on the matter.
Tsehai couldnt disagree more. The fact that theyve been trying to shroud bills that are openly trying to curb the freedom of expression is ridiculous, she says. Id almost say its Orwellian, but I prefer Kafka.
The cybercrime law sits uneasily with Tanzanias membership of the open government partnership initiative , which is meant to make government business more transparent to citizens. Tanzania has a long tradition of official wariness of providing information and handling criticism.
Independent media only appeared 10 years ago, but really took off in the past five years with the proliferation of more than 800 newspapers. Many of these pop up at election time, with a clear political agenda. However, politicians quickly managed to buy or close outlets and, according to former journalists, encourage self-censorship.
Mobile phones have changed things. Jamii has more than a million followers on Facebook, 28 million mobile subscribers and up to 600,000 people using its online forum every day.
The people in power  are finding that they have to deal with the jungle, something they cant control, which is the internet, says Tsehai.
The Cybercrimes Act seeks to deal with the rambunctious new media by decreeing that anyone sending or receiving unsolicited messages can be penalised for sharing them, be it through text messages, Facebook or Twitter.
Tsehai fears the authorities will send some citizens to jail so that they can be examples for the people, and terrify them into policing their own thoughts.

Another law, the 2013 Statistics Act , also deters Tanzanians from using or quoting anything but official government figures and data. Jamiis plans to get citizens to post polling station reports in October is in jeopardy because the punishment for publishing false or misleading statistical information without lawful authorisation from the National Bureau of Statistics is a year in jail, a 10m shilling (3,246) fine, or both.
After attempting to plant moles among Jamiis staff, politicians are now offering to buy advertising at hugely inflated rates in an attempt to sway the sites owners. They would rather shut down a site that is growing at 25% a month than buy it.
I do not believe in money. I believe in people, says Melo, 39, whose phone buzzes all the time with requests to join the site or attempts by hackers to silence him. Jamii, who gave up a relatively lucrative civil engineering job to work for virtually nothing, uses profits from advertising mainly on paying the 50 staff who edit up to 50,000 comments a day.
Melo survives on four hours sleep a night, because he vets new users and verifies all the information before it goes up, to ensure Jamiis credibility and avoid legal problems.
That will become more difficult if other bills affecting the media are passed. Meanwhile, Melo and others fear an even bigger crackdown on dissenting voices. If Ive already been questioned 17 times [so far], Ill probably be questioned 100 times in a month because they want to get everything, they want to have everything.

The great strength of the millennium development goals was their ability to focus the minds of the development industry and, to some extent, governments on a handful of key priorities, such as child survival, basic education and womens rights.
But that was also their weakness. It inevitably meant that equally important themes were excluded, and, by extension, it meant the exclusion of those countries and constituencies for which these other themes were the main concerns.
So the oft-expressed critique that the sustainable development goals are too broad, and that we need a kind of MDG-plus agenda, is misplaced. We need this SDG agenda precisely because it brings in other issues, most obviously links to global environmental problems but also the economic and structural causes of the social issues emphasised by the MDGs.
Related: If we want to end poverty, we need to be able to measure it properly
Most important, perhaps, as I have argued , is that the SDGs overturn an embedded but old-fashioned paradigm: the idea that there are developing and developed countries. The SDGs will apply to all countries, not just a sub-group.
This inclusivity is one of the reasons that the SDGs could be a success. While the MDGs were resented by some countries as someone elses agenda, the SDGs are explicitly fully negotiated and agreed across the board.
If you wanted a list of priorities, then the SDGs are not for you. It is hard to think of a statement of intent by the worlds nations that is as comprehensive and visionary as the SDG agenda set to be acclaimed in New York in September . In a sense, it is more from the family of grand UN visions than a specific action plan.
Certainly, there are 17 goals. But the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) has 30 articles, none of which carry an action plan or indicators to monitor progress. Smart targets did not yet exist. But it sets out a vision, justifying and supporting progressive attitudes everywhere. It has since been translated into more than 300 languages , a world record. Insofar as documents signed many miles away can be useful to ordinary people struggling to fulfil their rights and potential, it does its job.
So I am broadly an SDG fan, because I hope it will do something similar. Having said that, there is no doubt that it is actions that matter, not just words. We need to set the SDG negotiators, and the governments they work for, a triple A challenge: the SDG agenda needs to be ambitious, actionable and accountable.
Ambition will not be a problem. It is the other two As we need to work on.
Related: EU must pull its weight to help create a better global financial system
In a new paper bringing together lessons from conversations held between a number of governments about how to implement the SDGs, David Steven, senior fellow at NYUs Center on International Cooperation , emphasises two things: the need to integrate the most important aspects of the agenda into national plans, and the need to improve data.
Translating the SDG agenda as agreed on the international stage into a workable action plan at the national level will be the big challenge. Steven says we must lose no time in getting started, arguing that any delay will be costly. I would add that momentum is critical  these are political targets and politics is all about the moment.
Steven makes clear that countries are not yet ready to deliver, and that prioritisation, even within this explicitly holistic and universal agenda, is not a dirty word  as long as the toughest challenges are not shunned.
Of data, there is already a great deal written  here is my tuppence worth . But there is no doubt that the international community must help countries improve evidence and information as they seek to meet the SDGs.
So much for actioning the SDGs. What about accountability? Of course, this is intimately related with action. If civil society, along with more formal accountability bodies, does not hold government to account with both political pressure and solid evidence, then we cant expect much action.
The vision of a world in which human rights are respected is still an inspiration to read, almost 70 years since it was first put on paper.
The SDG agenda is also visionary and inspiring. As the long process of drawing up the next set of global goals reaches its final straight, its ambition is assured. It is time to turn our attention to action and accountability in the hope of giving the whole process a triple A rating.

Facing snakes, scorpions  and fear of attack  on Kenyas Walk of Hope
A 728km trek on treacherous bush roads from Garissa to the Ethiopian border aims to promote peace in this long-neglected region

We set off on the morning of 13 June from the town of Garissa in eastern Kenya . At first, our group was hundreds-strong, and included officials from the county and national government, all of us walking together to restore dignity and promote peace in a long-neglected region.
After 11km, only seven walkers remained as people offered their excuses, wished us luck and headed back into a town made infamous when Somali insurgents from al-Shabaab killed 147 people, mainly young students, on a university campus in April.
As I write, those of us who continued the Walk of Hope have covered 500km, heading deep into Kenyas North Eastern province. Our destination: border point one in Mandera, a town near Kenyas borders with Ethiopia and Somalia. In all, we planned to cover a gruelling 728km.
In one place, an old man insisted on offering us tea. The borehole there broke in 1978. No one had bothered to repair it
In north-eastern Kenya, the land is flat with sparse vegetation cover. Temperatures soar to 40C during the day and the nights can be cold and windy. Most people living here are ethnic Somalis, as am I.
The idea was to walk every day to the nearest settlement, by whatever means, covering between 15km and 43km. We never planned to sleep in the bush  we feared the snakes and scorpions.
As it turned out, we saw many scorpions on the road and just three snakes. It can be a little disappointing if you build an expectation.
Our choice of food was informed by ease of preparation rather than anything else. None of us felt like competent cooks. We packed a pickup full of tinned tuna, juice, energy drinks, dates and mineral water.The settlements we walked through typically featured a mixture of permanent and semi-permanent houses, a small school, a clinic and a borehole, if the residents were lucky.
The unlucky ones had just a school and maybe a borehole producing saline water. Clinics are a luxury in these places. The economy revolves round livestock: the settlements boom in the rainy season and bust during the dry season.
In one village, an old man insisted on offering us tea. The borehole there had broken in 1978, and nobody had bothered to repair it. I was born that year.
One thing stood out in all the villages we passed through: each had a beautiful little mosque with solar lighting and a booming speaker for the call to prayer. Some settlements had two mosques, competing for attention.
I was exhausted all the time and felt like I was walking on thorns, always inches away from giving up
On average, we walked 30km every day with the aim of finishing the walk in 25 days. Thats a brisk pace, which results in blisters and muscle pains. At 38, I was the oldest walker, an unfit lecturer: I was not a star performer. I was exhausted all the time and felt like I was walking on thorns, always inches away from giving up. My blisters became well known when I posted a picture on Facebook of my swollen feet, and the BBCs Somali service picked up the story. My blisters are overshadowing my real self, I mused. Red Cross paramedics followed us, ready to deal with our injuries, and sometimes offering massages.
In one settlement, people were bemused by these strange walkers. They had not yet heard about the Walk of Hope. So they grilled us to make sure we were not thugs or hoodlums. Then, they gave us mats and a temporary shed to sleep in. We were welcomed in many settlements with the traditional honour of slaughtering a goat.
The most challenging part of the walk was fasting. Fasting is obligatory for us Muslims during Ramadan, and since the walk is not a necessity we could not excuse ourselves on account of being travellers. We walked at night and rested during the day. This had its challenges: at night, we could not see what was in the bush.
We were not scared of wild animals  the lion is the only dangerous animal in these parts and all we saw were footprints. One night, we happened on a feisty hyena feeding on the carcass of a goat, but we were too tired to be bothered.
Whenever we reached a settlement, we visited the school and the health centre to check on provision there. Non-Somali teachers have refused to work in north-eastern Kenya after several attacks by al-Shabaab on non-Muslim citizens. Health workers were also scared away. We wanted to document the effects of these shortages.
We discovered that schools were terribly understaffed even before the attacks began.
The biggest problem in the many health centres we visited was the complete absence of doctors
In many places, the local community operates the government schools as if they were private institutions: they employ untrained teachers and students pay fees. No standards are enforceable, and the central examination system is a farce since students are not subjected to the same curriculum, teaching materials or teaching hours.
The biggest problem in the many health centres we visited was the complete absence of doctors. The best one can hope for is a nursing officer or a medical officer with a diploma from a medical training college. In Kenya, it seems, doctors are the preserve of city dwellers.
Security was always on our minds. Northern Kenya is often depicted as a wild land where bandits roam. Walking on the road made us vulnerable. We took all threats seriously  we could not be complacent.
One night we were camping in the bush when one of the guys saw a post on Facebook claiming that al-Shabaab wanted to attack the Walk of Hope. We were in the bush, 30km from the nearest settlement. We convinced ourselves that the fellow posting the threat was just seeking likes and decided to ignore it. I hardly slept that night, but not because I was scared  a very cold wind was blowing and I thought we would freeze to death, before anyone had a chance to attack us.
Similar posts appeared on the same page the next day. One night while trekking on a dirt road, a vehicle stopped a short distance away and three people jumped out and ran into the bush. We thought, This is it! but the attack never came. Nonetheless, we ran for our lives, straining our muscles and blistering our feet. It was the worst night of the walk.
And suddenly, that was the end of my journey: the rest could continue but my feet could no longer take the strain. Egg-sized blisters appeared between my toes, and my feet swelled up. I needed to see a doctor.
The Walk of Hope continues.
Salah Abdi Sheikh is an activist, author and former dean of the school of business and technology at Umma University. The other walkers are now at El Wak, about 175km from Mandera, which they hope to reach in six to eight days. Sheikh hopes to join them for the final 20km

Why developing countries need to toughen up on taxes
Dutch minister Lilianne Ploumen explains how implementing a fairer, more transparent tax system will be vital in the financing of the SDGs

Next week, the UN financing conference in Addis Ababa will take decisions that will have a profound impact on the global community over the next 15 years and beyond. Tax collection in developing countries will determine whether the sustainable development goals can rival the success of the millennium development goals , which expire this year.
For most developing countries, tax revenue lies somewhere between 10% and 15% of gross domestic product. Thats low compared with an average of about 35% for developed countries. In historical terms, however, its not that low. Throughout the 19th century, in all western countries tax revenue was below 10%. In his book, Capital in the Twenty-First Century , Thomas Piketty shows us that it was only after 1910 that tax revenue slowly started rising.
Low tax revenues meant that governments were able to fund only the most basic services, such as policing, the courts and the armed forces. Universal access to healthcare or education, infrastructure and a social safety net  in short, the foundations for decent, prosperous lives  call for much higher tax revenues.

This goal can be achieved, perhaps sooner than many of us ever dared dream. Success in the fight against hunger and poverty, under the banner of the MDGs, has changed our perception of what is possible. Now, the worlds bold new ambition is to leave no one behind.
To achieve this, we will have to, at last, realise the full potential of developing countries. This is known as domestic resource mobilisation, and it all starts with higher rates of tax revenue collection.
In order to be able to finance their share of the SDGs, developing countries will have to increase tax revenue collection to about 20% of GDP, according to the UN . I see three main areas for action.
First, ensure fair taxation. The urgency here is overwhelming. The UN Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) estimates that multinationals avoid $100bn worth of corporation tax in developing countries. Governments and international institutions now have to make good on promises to fight tax avoidance and tax evasion.
Second, strengthen tax inspectors. Developing countries need support to broaden their tax base and build tax collection capacity. Two years ago, the Netherlands started giving technical assistance to developing countries, and we now plan to double our current contribution. Today, we are active in 10 countries and we are starting an initiative to generate extra resources for building tax collection capacity.
I believe this is a good investment, because internationally the rate of return on such support is way over a factor of 10. We plan to launch this initiative at the Addis summit.
Countries that want to use these extra resources will need to express the political will to reform their tax systems. In developing countries, tax systems often have a regressive effect because they tend to rely heavily on consumption taxes, like VAT and excise duty, or on import levies. The poor end up paying a relatively high amount of tax because they spend all their income on goods subject to VAT, such as groceries and phone credit. And they pay import levies on their mobiles. There is no tax-free shopping for the poor.
Third, broaden the tax base. Developing countries need more capacity to administer and collect more complex forms of tax, like income and wealth taxes. Apart from VAT, countries need a progressive income tax regime. Because the poor are often hit harder by income tax too.
In Zambia, for instance, the sugar picker and the woman with a market stall pay more tax than the sugar factory itself. Businesses can use smart tax arrangements  tax avoidance tactics, in other words  to ensure they pay less than 1% in tax. While the market seller has to pay four times that rate on the couple of dollars she earns. That is not only wrong from a gender perspective; its completely unfair.
Thats why I am delighted that we have already agreed with five countries to revise our tax treaties. We have signed a new treaty with Malawi, and signed an amendment with Ethiopia, and we are holding discussions with seven other countries on updating treaties.
In total, we are looking to revise our treaties with 23 countries. Anti-abuse provisions  defining which companies get access to the treaty benefits  will ensure that the Netherlands is no longer an attractive option for companies that use tax avoidance tactics. Theirs is the kind of business we would rather do without.
These anti-abuse provisions are meant to exclude companies that only establish themselves in a third state to benefit from tax treaty advantages through that country, without having any other activities in that third state.
Finally, we regularly urge developing countries to be more discerning when awarding tax exemptions. The Netherlands is now putting its money where its mouth is. Along with other countries, we are prepared to forgo tax exemptions on goods and services that fall under official development assistance.
The task before us is daunting. The leap from the billions we needed for the MDGs to the trillions we will need to make the SDGs a success is a big one. But just consider what weve achieved already.
Ending hunger is within the grasp of this generation  a feat that seemed inconceivable only a generation ago. We must redouble our efforts if we want to do the same with poverty. It is possible to make the billions we provide in official development assistance spark the trillions that we need in private sector resources.
Above all, I see ways for developing countries to increase their tax revenues. That will enable them to unleash their full potential at last.

The goals were intended to serve as a precise, memorable and measurable way to focus development policy in the first years of the 21st century and to improve the lives of hundreds of millions of the worlds poorest people.
Underlying them, however, was a simple if stunning ambition; an epochal call to arms.
We will spare no effort to free our fellow men, women and children from the abject and dehumanising conditions of extreme poverty, to which more than a billion of them are currently subjected, ran the Millennium Declaration that was adopted at the summit.
We are committed to making the right to development a reality for everyone and to freeing the entire human race from want.
Related: UN: 15-year push ends extreme poverty for a billion people
If progress on the MDGs has been mixed  and the final report plainly admits that it has  then their architects can at least claim that progress on ending extreme poverty has been spectacular: between 1990 and this year, the number of those living in extreme poverty has fallen from 1.9 billion to 836 million.
Improvements in many other areas have been less impressive, however. Last year, the the UN deputy secretary general, Jan Eliasson, bemoaned the lack of action on clean water and sanitation , warning that the slow progress in building toilets and ending open defecation was having a staggering effect on the health, safety, education, prosperity and dignity of 2.5 billion people.
His comments came two months after Unesco admitted that there was no chance whatsoever that the millennium development goal of achieving universal primary education by 2015 would be met.
The MDGs have often been criticised for their naivety, their narrow interpretation of the ethos behind the millennium declaration and for their lack of focus on longterm, sustainable development. But they are at least acknowledged to have concentrated global attention on their separate eight areas.
Many fear that the MDGs replacements  the sustainable development goals , which will be agreed by the UN in September  will struggle to do even that.
Whereas the MDGs consisted of eight goals supported by 21 specific targets and 60 indicators, there are currently 17 SDGs comprising 169 targets. The number of indicators has yet to be set but there are likely to be hundreds .
The sheer number of goals, targets and indicators has prompted some to worry that the SDGs will be a hard sell.
The British prime minister, David Cameron, has made it clear that he favours fewer.
I dont believe they will cut it at 17, he said last year . There are too many to communicate effectively. Theres a real danger they will end up sitting on a bookshelf, gathering dust.
Despite this, the numbers look unlikely to change as reaching agreement even on 17 has been a long, hard slog.
But the UN is acutely aware of the need to grab peoples attention with the SDGs, which will set the development agenda until 2030. During last years SDG negotiations, the secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, grouped the goals into six essential elements: dignity, people, planet, prosperity, justice and partnership.
If the numerous SDGs are to make an impression on the global consciousness, they will need careful packaging and a simple, unifying message.
As Helen Clark, the head of the UN Development Programme , put it in January : We need to catch peoples imagination with this because if you just say sustainable development, eyes glaze. If you say, 17 goals, it takes a genius to recite the 17.

At the end of a school day in the South Sudanese capital, Juba, young girls in light brown uniforms walk home, chatting in the late-afternoon sun. The scene should be repeated all over the country but over the past year and a half the civil war has forced hundreds of thousands of children out of school nationwide.
Education is one of the hidden casualties of South Sudans latest conflict, which began in December 2013 and shows little sign of ending. School buildings have been requisitioned by soldiers, pupils and their teachers have been press-ganged into armed groups, and an estimated 400,000 children have been forced out of school.
In the three worst affected states, Jonglei, Upper Nile and Unity, 70% of the 1,200 schools have been closed. In some counties, not a single school is open.

The education sector was a concern even before the war broke out: the national literacy rate of 27% was one of the lowest in the world, and primary school enrolment (47%) and completion (10%) rates were also unimpressive, though better than they had been during the long years of conflict before South Sudan seceded from Sudan.
At independence four years ago this week, South Sudan was one of the least developed countries in the world, and the new schools created in peace time were often extremely basic. Nevertheless, some progress was made. The countrys subsequent rapid descent into civil war reversed many of those slight gains.
Aliza Ruai knows what that feels like. She had been a student in Lich primary school, in Unity state, when the war began. In June 2014, she was forced to flee as the violence surged towards her home.
We could only move at night, says the 17-year-old. I couldnt see the fighting but I heard the guns. I was feeling very bad. I was afraid. My father was taken in April before we fled. I have not seen him since.
She missed her exams because of the fighting, and spent more time out of school as she looked after younger siblings. Now, though, she is studying again, at a makeshift school in the UN camp where she lives on the outskirts of Bentiu, the state capital.
Because I want a good life, I will study, she says. Maybe I can be a doctor or a teacher.
Samuel Liom is at the same school. He was 14 before he first went to school, since there wasnt one in his village. At first, he found it difficult to be in a class with much younger children, but he enjoyed learning so much that he overcame his embarrassment.
My favourite subject is social science because you learn how other countries are doing on justice and social issues
Samuel Liom
Like Aliza, Samuel was forced to flee the fighting in Unity state  what he calls the shooting and lootings  and dead bodies by the side of the road. At first, he wasnt sure whether it was worth going to school in the camp, but sitting around doing nothing became frustrating. Now he is back at school, and hopes to get a job with the UN. The civil war has sharpened the focus of his studies.
My favourite subject is social science because you will learn the world story  how other countries are doing in terms of justice and social issues, he says. If you do social studies, you know the heart of the country.
South Sudan needs peace, Samuel says, to allow him and others to lead normal lives.
Both Aliza and Samuel are studying at a school supported by Unicef as part of its Back to Learning Campaign , which has reached 121,000 children and hopes to help three times as many. Funding, though, is in short supply.

When a war breaks out, education sinks down the list of priorities. In 2014, around 1% of humanitarian spending went on education.
As the world meets in Oslo this week for a Summit on Education for Development , Unicef will argue for a higher priority for education in humanitarian emergencies.
We have to keep in mind that conflicts today, like in South Sudan, are lasting much longer, so we have to rethink the way traditional humanitarian assistance is provided, says Phuong T Nguyen from Unicef, in South Sudan.
Aspects of education are life-saving: how to protect yourself from cholera, the use of clean water, how to protect yourself from gender-based violence. Its not in the same sense as food but it is life-saving.
Many in South Sudan would agree. Edmund Yakani is a prominent activist who organises programmes to help provide schooling for children affected by conflict. Hes concerned that an entire generation is growing up without a proper education  making South Sudans future prospects even bleaker.
Even areas not directly affected by conflict are overwhelmed, he says. Class sizes have grown from around 45 to well over 100 in many cases, reducing the quality of education. And many teachers are getting work as humanitarians because the money is better. The educational cost of this war is high.

        <title>UN: 15-year push ends extreme poverty for a billion people</title>

The millennium development goals (MDGs) have driven the most successful anti-poverty movement in history and brought more than a billion people out of extreme penury , but their achievements have been mixed and the world remains deeply riven by inequality, the UN s final report on the goals has concluded.
Ban Ki-moon , the UN secretary general, said that while the 15-year push to meet the eight goals  on poverty , education , gender equality , child mortality , maternal health , disease , the environment and global partnership  had yielded some astonishing results, it had left too many people behind.
MDG 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger
The MDGs helped to lift more than one billion people out of extreme poverty, to make inroads against hunger, to enable more girls to attend school than ever before and to protect our planet, he said.
Yet for all the remarkable gains, I am keenly aware that inequalities persist and that progress has been uneven.
While the world has reduced the number of people living on less than $1.25 a day from 1.9 billion in 1990 to 836 million in 2015, the target of halving the proportion of people suffering from hunger was narrowly missed.
Between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of undernourished people fell from 23.3% to 12.9%. Current estimates suggest around 795 million people are undernourished  the overwhelming majority of them in developing regions. Progress has been hindered by higher food and energy prices, extreme weather, natural disasters, political instability, humanitarian crises and the economic recession of the late 1990s and in 2008-2009.
Ban noted that in 2011, nearly 60% of the worlds extremely poor people lived in five countries  India, Nigeria, China, Bangladesh and the Democratic Republic of Congo  and that familiar divisions and inequities were as stark as ever.
Too many women continue to die during pregnancy or from childbirth-related complications, he said. Progress tends to bypass women and those who are lowest on the economic ladder or are disadvantaged because of their age, disability or ethnicity. Disparities between rural and urban areas remain pronounced.
MDG 2: Achieve universal primary education
Progress on education has been mixed: the goal of achieving universal primary education has also just been missed, with the net enrolment rate rising from 83% in 2000 to 91% this year. The literacy rate for those aged 15 to 24 showed an identical rise, while the number of out-of-school children fell from 100 million 15 years ago to 57 million today.
Despite having to contend with a rising population, high levels of poverty and armed conflicts, sub-Saharan Africa made the greatest progress in primary school enrolment of all the developing regions, with its rate growing from 52% in 1990 to 78% in 2012.

The push for gender equality and to empower women has led to about two-thirds of developing countries achieving gender parity in primary education  underlining the fact that the aspiration of eliminating gender disparity in primary and secondary education has not been met.
When it comes to employment outside the agricultural sector, women now constitute 41% of paid workers, up from 35% in 1990. Although the proportion of women in parliament has nearly doubled over the past 20 years, only one in every five seats is held by a woman. Efforts to narrow the gender divide continue to be stymied by discrimination in law and practice, violence against women and girls, unequal employment opportunities and unequal division of unpaid care and domestic work.
While the child mortality rate has declined by more than half over the past 25 years  falling from 90 to 43 deaths per 1,000 live births  it has not declined by the MDG aim of two-thirds. Vaccination helped to prevent nearly 15.6m deaths from measles between 2000 and 2013, but that progress has slowed since 2010, with an estimated 21.6 million infants not receiving the vaccine in 2013. The biggest preventable causes of death for children under five are pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria, which between them claim 16,000 lives a day.
MDG 4: Reduce child mortality
The aspiration of reducing the maternal mortality ratio by three-quarters has not been realised, with the ratio falling by nearly half (from 380 deaths per 100,000 live births to 210). Today, only half of pregnant women in developing regions receive the recommended minimum of four antenatal visits, and a quarter of babies worldwide are delivered without skilled care. Postpartum haemorrhage accounted for 27% of maternal deaths in developing regions between 2003 and 2009; other major complications were high blood pressure during pregnancy, complications from delivery and unsafe abortion.
Progress on combating HIV/Aids, malaria and other diseases has also varied. The target of halting and beginning to reverse the spread of HIV/Aids by 2015 has not been met, although the number of new HIV infections fell by around 40% between 2000 and 2013, from 3.5 million cases to 2.1 million. The fight is being hindered by risky sexual behaviour and a lack of basic knowledge about HIV among young people in many countries.
The target of halting and reversing the incidence of malaria has been achieved thanks to a tenfold increase in international financing since 2000 and sustained malaria prevention and treatment initiatives. Insecticide-treated mosquito nets, indoor spraying, diagnostic testing and the use of effective drugs have helped prevent more than 6.2m deaths from the disease between 2000 and 2015. The global malaria incidence rate has fallen by more than a third and the mortality rate by more than half. Significant progress has been made in the fight against tuberculosis: improved prevention, diagnosis and treatment saved an estimated 37m lives between 2000 and 2013.
The push for environmental sustainability has brought some 2.6 billion people access to improved drinking water since 1990, meaning that the target of halving the proportion of people without access to improved sources of water was achieved in 2010  five years ahead of schedule. However, 663 million are still without improved drinking water.
MDG 7: Ensure environmental sustainability
Efforts on sanitation have fared far less well: 2.1 billion people have gained access to improved sanitation (a toilet that hygienically separates faeces from human contact) since 1990, leaving the target of halving the number of people without access to basic sanitation short by nearly 700 million people.
Some 2.4 billion people in developing countries  a third of humanity  still lack access to improved sanitation facilities, while 946 million people still practise open defecation.
The differences between rural and urban areas are often considerable. While four out of five people in urban areas have access to piped drinking water, the figure for those in rural areas is just one in three. Nearly half of those in rural areas lack access to improved sanitation facilities compared with less than a fifth of those in urban areas.
Moves to improve the way the world works together on development have been aided by an increase in the amount of official development assistance (ODA) that rich countries give to developing nations. Between 2000 and 2014, ODA increased by 66% in real terms and hit a record high of $134.8bn (80.3bn) in 2013 .
Ban said that lessons had to be learned from the MDGs as the world prepares to agree their successors, the sustainable development goals , which will set the agenda for the next 15 years.
We need to tackle root causes and do more to integrate the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development, he said.
Reflecting on the MDGs and looking ahead to the next 15 years, there is no question that we can deliver on our shared responsibility to end poverty, leave no one behind and create a world of dignity for all.

The new Ebola outbreak in Liberia last week was not unexpected, and more like it may occur, according to the UN special envoy on Ebola, Dr David Nabarro.
The 17-year-old whose death signalled the outbreak in Liberia may have come into contact with an infected animal or picked up the virus from a person in whom it had lingered beyond the 21-day quarantine period, experts believe.

Two more people from the teenagers village have fallen ill since the boys death last Sunday, but although the new cases have dismayed the government, population and health experts, Nabarro said that because of the large amount of virus that has been in circulation, this could be the pattern for some time to come.
Were still pretty confident it is going to end, in a period which is not unreasonable, but I dont think the end will necessarily be the end. There will be subsequent mini flare-ups occurring all over the place, he said.
How the teenager became infected is the subject of rumour and speculation, because he is not thought to have come into contact with anybody from Sierra Leone or Guinea, where there are still cases.
But, said Nabarro, there has been an awful lot of virus around. Some of it may have gone back into the animal kingdom. That could mean the virus occurring in animals in locations where there was none in the past, increasing the chances of disease if people eat or are in physical contact with infected animals, such as fruit bats.
This epidemic has also shown that the virus can linger beyond the 21-day quarantine period in the prostate in men and in the eyes in both men and women, he said. It has been found in amniotic fluid and in the foetuses of women who were pregnant when they became infected with Ebola but survived.
We dont know yet whether they are an undetected chain of transmission, because Margibi [the county where the cases occurred] was one of the last parts of Liberia to be declared Ebola-free, or whether they are the result of some kind of perpetuation of the virus, survivors that we hadnt known about, or whether they represent a brand-new arrival of the virus from outside the human race  a new Ebola appearance  and that answer will not be known for some time, Nabarro said.
Examination of past Ebola outbreaks since the disease was first identified four decades ago shows a 50% probability of isolated mini outbreaks within a year after the main one has been declared over, he said. While there is not absolute clarity on this, it appeared that the reasons were perpetuation of the virus in survivors or re-introduction from animals which may have picked it up from infected humans.
Nabarro praised the calm and confident Liberian response to the new cases, as well as the handling of the continuing epidemic in the other affected countries. The communities in Sierra Leone and Guinea where there are still cases now need to be approached with great sensitivity, said Nabarro.
These are communities that want to be left alone, with their cultural values and traditions undisturbed, he said. It was important to focus on individual households in a quiet and non-aggressive way and listen to them. People are very, very scared, he said. They are scared they are going to get into trouble with the authorities but they are scared that they will get into trouble with the spiritual world if they dont do their burials right. It needs a very sensitive response.
Nabarro was speaking before a major UN conference aimed at encouraging donations to help the three hard-hit west African countries recover from the damage of the epidemic.
At the secretary generals international conference on early recovery, which begins on Friday in New York, donors are expected to offer help with restoring health and education systems, but it is thought likely the governments of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea will hope for more assistance to rebuild their economies.

        <title>Make poverty history? A decade on from Gleneagles, it is a genuine possibility | Adrian Lovett</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/06/make-poverty-history-campaign-gleneagles-sustainable-development-goals</Link>

It is hard to believe that, when world leaders met at Gleneagles 10 years ago on Monday , nobody on the planet had an iPhone, YouTube was preparing to open its first office above a Silicon Valley pizza house, and tweeting was confined to birds. But looking back on that day, when the Make Poverty History campaign reached its climax at the G8 summit, it is clear the world has changed in many more ways.
On 6 July 2005 I was in Edinburgh, preparing to head to Gleneagles to make our case. Days earlier, we had mobilised half a million people at the huge Edinburgh Make Poverty History rally  the largest in Scottish history  and at the Live 8 concerts in London and around the world. Seven million white campaign wristbands had been worn in the UK, and tens of millions more worldwide, challenging leaders to act. The G8s answer included a promise of $48bn (31bn) in new aid  half of it to Africa  and outright debt cancellation for many of the worlds poorest countries.
It wasnt everything the campaign had asked for, and it hasnt all been plain sailing since. Shamefully, some of the richest countries have reneged on the promises they made that day. But the deal done at Gleneagles, unlike the faded Nokia 3310 I clutched back then, has looked better with the passing of time. Those who kept their word, along with strong political leadership from within Africa itself, have helped transform the world since.
Related: What can G7's dwindling anti-poverty protesters learn from climate activists?
The change becomes real when seen up close. A while ago I visited a government health clinic supported by Save the Children in South Wollo, Ethiopia, eight hours drive from the capital. With increased aid and its own resources, the Ethiopian government has been able to extend the treatment of deadly childhood illnesses like diarrhoea and pneumonia, with a new army of equipped and empowered community health workers.
I was shown a meticulously maintained record book listing each patient that came in  mainly children  with names, symptoms, diagnosis and treatment. The final column on the ledger was headed outcome; in each row, the entry almost invariably contained a single word: better. The same was true in one clinic after another. Seeing that combination of real, micro-level data with demonstrable success and progress was exhilarating. I wished that every white-band wearer in the world could have stood there too and read that roll call of hope.
Perhaps the most profound change is in the perceived achievability of Make Poverty Historys mission. In 2005, despite Nelson Mandelas insistence that extreme poverty could be overcome just like slavery and apartheid, many observers  and even some campaigners  assumed it was an unreachable pipedream.

Ten years on, that aim of ensuring that nobody should live in absolute poverty by 2030 is set to be enshrined in the sustainable development goals , which will be signed by world leaders at the UN this September. The campaign slogan has become the first item on the worlds to-do list. And the reason for that new sense of possibility? Were halfway there.
The extreme poverty figure has dropped from 43% of the worlds people in 1990 to 21% in 2010 . And its continuing to fall. The virtual elimination of extreme poverty in the next 15 years wont be easy  in fact, it will be an increasingly hard slog. But nobody now says it cannot be done. The question is whether we will choose to do it.
Policymakers need to start to answer that question this month when they gather for the financing for development summit due to be held, neatly, in Addis Ababa  capital city of the country that became a byword for famine 30 years ago and is now at the frontline of the data-driven fight to end hunger and extreme poverty for good.
If the map of poverty and development has transformed in 10 years, the way we run campaigns has changed almost as much  and thats a change for the better, too. Networks like Avaaz and change.org , unheard of in 2005, have harnessed internet and social media platforms to put power in peoples hands and turn leadership pyramids upside down.
A growing movement of global citizens is forming. And that movement is more authentic and representative than ever, no longer directed from Washington, New York or London. One s membership of nearly 7 million people includes 2 million from Africa. After watching 250 One youth ambassadors from across Europe and beyond, who came (with some very big balloons) to southern Germany for last months G7 summit , I know we are in great shape for the fight ahead. These are smart, savvy, passionate advocates who know their facts. They also know that facts are nothing without activism  and activism means little unless we take it to where decisions are made, get them changed, and hold decision-makers accountable.
Not so different from Make Poverty History perhaps, at its best. But  I hope  more global, more sustainable and more empowering. Oh, and now we can tweet about it too.

        <MainBody>Financing for Development
In global healthcare, quality and access are what matters  not who delivers it
In fragile states, private sector healthcare is vital in plugging the gaps in public services. We need to engage with it  like it or not, it may be the only option

When the UN financing for development conference begins in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, theres likely to be a big elephant in the room: the private sector.
Some commentators have warned of the possible implications of pursuing ultra-free market ideologies that see private companies as key providers of basic public services. Ignoring the private sector rather than working with it would seem like the most morally defensible approach when faced with the prospect of large corporations selling health and education services with the sole objective of turning a profit.
Related: Health sustainable development goal must tackle inequity head on to succeed
Sometimes, though  whether we like it or not  the private sector might be our only option. Take fragile and conflict-affected states: the World Bank estimates that more than 1.2 billion people live in countries affected by widespread conflict and political unrest. The UK Department for International Development and other donors have flagged these countries as a priority category.
Given their vulnerability, fragile and conflict-affected states simply do not have access to the large amounts of state expenditure needed to provide widespread coverage of basic services. World Health Organisation data from 2013 shows that in Afghanistan, government expenditure on health amounted to just 21% of total health expenditure (compared with 84% in the UK).
Donors are also unlikely to commit to long-term aid funding where they cant easily link this expenditure to immediate, tangible outcomes  an unrealistic expectation in fragile states where, by definition, the focus needs to be on long-term systemic change.
In these contexts, it is hardly surprising that privately run services step in to plug the gap. In Somalia, despite the population having one of the lowest rates of GDP per capita in the world , the private sector delivers more than 60% of the countrys healthcare services . In these situations, where the private sector is already a fixture, the question is not how to prevent companies from filling the gap left by ineffective state structures, but rather how to work with these companies to ensure the gap-filling is good enough to promote positive, lasting impact.
Related: Financing the sustainable development goals  podcast
There are some fundamental areas that need addressing.
First, a lack of regulatory frameworks and inspection procedures can result in huge negative social and economic consequences. Our work , investigating private healthcare provision in Somalia, highlighted some disturbing results: the proliferation and sale of unregulated and potentially dangerous pharmaceutical products not only puts patients at risk but is also likely to lead to a greater burden on public health services when remedial treatments are needed further down the line.
Poor market oversight can also make life difficult for businesses trying to tailor their products and services to appropriate customer bases. In Somalia, the unfettered boom in hospitals and smaller clinics has made it difficult for enterprises to differentiate themselves, resulting in negative competition that benefits neither the business nor the customer.
The public sector has a key role to play in addressing these issues, helping to ensure the introduction and enforcement of minimum standards and accreditations. This will necessitate meaningful collaboration between the sectors  working with, rather than against, private enterprises. In some cases, NGOs are stepping in to fill the void. In Somaliland, PSI s network of recognisable BulshoKaab Pharmacies is a good example of a successful attempt to give credibility to quality services in an ever-expanding marketplace.
In Somaliland and Puntland, we are seeing the emergence of informal referral systems whereby the private sector sends emergency cases to the public sector, and public sector facilities pass on cases requiring specialist skills and equipment to their private sector counterparts. We found a general desire among health workers to formalise these relationships to help improve basic efficiencies  for example, by establishing systems allowing data on the availability of beds to be shared.
In critically vulnerable environments, it is clearly important that we work with what is already in place to support the delivery of basic services. Private sector facilities spring up to plug the gap left behind by weak public institutions and a lack of capacity and funding. Their continued existence is testament to the demand for them. While this might not be to everyones ideological taste, it is sometimes the reality on the ground. In fragile and conflict-affected states, it is often the only reality.
The public sector has an important role to play in promoting the regulation and oversight of these services, ensuring they are really working for the customers they aim  and claim  to serve. Sustainable development goal 17 talks of engaging with the private sector to help strengthen the global partnership for sustainable development.
It is time to catch up with private service providers to ensure this engagement is truly sustainable. What should matter is quality and access. Not who delivers it.

Murder, drug cartels and misery counter Argentina's claims of falling poverty
President Cristina Fernndez de Kirchners suggestion that Argentinas poverty rate has been cut to less than 5% rings false with experts and locals alike

The gangland murder of four youths in a notorious slum in the south of Buenos Aires came as little surprise to residents. The victims of last Aprils attack had each been shot in the head by hitmen amid an ongoing turf war between rival gangs.
Known as  villas miserias   literally, slums of misery  the sprawls of redbrick shacks that punctuate the Parisian-style architecture of the Argentinian capital have become synonymous with violence.
These marginal neighbourhoods have little or no state presence to oppose the growing influence of drug cartels. Despite often being located in urban centres, most residents do not have access to mains electricity, running water or sewers.
In 2013, the NGO Techo identified 1,834 of these informal settlements across Argentina, saying they were home to 500,000 families. In Buenos Aires alone, the number of people living in villas miserias grew by about 50% between 2001 and 2010.
These fringe communities have become the focal point of the fight against poverty in the South American country, with investment from the government and NGOs focused on providing basic services and integrating them into wider society.
After Argentinas devastating debt default in 2001/2, a boom in social security spending did much to sustain high growth rates. But the success of these social programmes has been threatened by another default and an inflation-inducing currency devaluation last year.
This bleak picture seems to sound a false note given the governments claims that Argentina has one of the lowest poverty rates in the world.
At a UN Food and Agriculture Organisation summit in Rome in June, President Cristina Fernndez de Kirchner said the poverty rate was now lower than 5%, compared with a crippling 54% in 2003.
When Anbal Fernndez, head of the Argentine cabinet, was later asked on national radio if the country had truly achieved a poverty rate lower than, say, Norway, Denmark and Germany, he replied: Yes, although you might not like it and it is difficult for you to accept. Countries like Germany are having a difficult time with poverty.
Even discounting the fact that poverty rates in Germany and other European countries are based on different calculations, the validity of figures published by Argentinas Indec statistics agency has long been challenged.
In terms of fiddling the figures, the [Fernndez presidency] has considerable form  from cooking the books on inflation, to massaging growth data and  fudging poverty data, said Colin M Lewis, professor emeritus and Argentina expert at the London School of Economics .
A regime that presents itself as a champion of the poor has even more reason than most for making exaggerated claims about poverty reduction, particularly as inflation accelerates and a decline in the rate of inequality appears to be stalling, he added.

It is widely acknowledged that Indec has long published an artificially low consumer price index (CPI). Private economists estimate inflation at more than 25% , while the government has said it is about 15%.
But despite evidence of creative accounting, there has also been real progress in tackling poverty, some analysts say.
The reason why the president has high approval ratings of around 50% is that many people have seen their living standards rise  unemployment is low and average wages have risen faster than prices during her tenure, even when you use the estimates of inflation favoured by the opposition, said Paul Segal, a senior economics lecturer at Kings College London .
Argentina measures its poverty rate by calculating the number of people who cannot afford a basic basket of goods and services, such as education and housing. This basket is directly linked to the CPI, which statisticians say can lead to abuse.
If inflation is high, the basket value increases, and therefore poverty increases. This is politically inexpedient for a president whose election, and continued popularity, is partially grounded in a promise to reduce poverty, said Christopher Wylde, associate professor of international relations at Richmond, the American International University in London .
Manipulating the official inflation rate serves a wider set of priorities, and its impact on poverty data could be interpreted as somewhat tangential. These wider priorities include: lower repayments on inflation-indexed bonds, better gross domestic product data  the impact on the real effective exchange rate and the concomitant impact on balance of payments through the trade channel, and a better bargaining position with unions, who use inflation data to negotiate pay increases, Wylde said.
An independent study by the Universidad Catlica Argentina , released in April last year and using more realistic CPI data, reported a poverty rate of roughly 26% in 2013.
Away from the rarefied air of pure statistics, in the low shacks of the villas miserias, people echo the charges of official exaggeration and manipulation, grounding their anger in daily deprivations.
In our neighbourhoods, entire families are homeless and theres no drinkable water. Where is this reduction in poverty? said Viviana, an NGO advocate who works in a slum in the gentrified barrio of Retiro in Buenos Aires. She did not want to give her last name for fear of harassment by the authorities.
Its a joke that the president would announce that [poverty rate] to the world. That number, so untenable to the Argentine eye, is something shed never say to the people who live in las villas miserias. Thats only something she could have said in Rome.
Indec has agreed to reform its methodology on measuring inflation and poverty but, given that no fresh data on poverty has been published since December 2013, it seems unlikely anything will change before legislative and presidential elections in October. Fernndez, whose Front for Victory party has held power since 2003, is barred from standing for a third consecutive term .
With persistent economic instability, fears about the prevalence of drug cartels and a creeping fiscal deficit , the ghosts of 2001 haunt every Argentine politician.

Yemen's humanitarian crisis leaves a million people in dire straits  in pictures
The UN has declared its highest-level humanitarian emergency in Yemen, where months of fighting and a blockade by a Saudi-led coalition have left about 80% of the population in need of aid. Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, has called for a pause in hostilities until the end of Ramadan so that assistance can be delivered. But a senior UN official warns the country is one step from famine

Yemen Fathiya is an Oromo from Ethiopia but has been living in Yemen for five years. She has three children, and came to this clinic in Sanaa to have her newborn girl immunised. She has not been able to pay rent for two months, and can hardly afford cooking gas and transport. Her husband used to work as a cleaner in a hospital but was dismissed three months ago.
I am stuck here, she says. If I could go back to Ethiopia I would, but I would get killed as we fled for political reasons  I get very afraid with the constant shelling. The children are afraid. But what can we do?

On Wednesday, a Saudi Arabian billionaire, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, announced he would donate his $32bn (20bn) fortune to charity over the coming years . The decision, he said, had been motivated by his life-long commitment to helping to build a more peaceful, equitable and sustainable world for generations to come.
If the money were split equally among the eight programmes the prince suggested  with $4bn going to each  what might it achieve? Here are some of the options.
Modernisation and infrastructure
The full $32bn, meanwhile, could take energy supplies to more than half the places off the grid in Africa (source: Overseas Development Institute ).
Poverty alleviation
A $4bn windfall would go about 80% of the way to ensuring every person in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  one of the poorest countries on the planet  has access to basic services such as health and education (source: ONE campaign ).
The same sum would cover the funding gap for essential health and education services for everyone in Tanzania , Zambia and Liberia (source: ONE campaign).
Disaster relief
$4bn would cover the total bill to help the Syrian refugees who have fled to nearby countries , providing essentials like clean water, adequate shelter and food assistance (source: Oxfam ).
A $4bn injection would fully fund roughly 20% of the current worldwide humanitarian needs. Or, more specifically, it would just about cover the gap in funding for the entire Syrian regional refugee response and the funding gap on South Sudan combined (source: Care International).
The same sum would almost cover the funding gap for 12 other ongoing humanitarian crises around the world (source: Care International).
Education and empowering children
With support worth $4bn, the 58 million children left behind by the millennium development goal on education would be able to go to primary school (source: Care International ).
Just $500,000 could enable 1,000 schools in Pakistan to use the latest technology to plan, prepare and manage against the risk of attacks, enabling children to attend school more safely. The sum would cover the creation of school safety strategies using analytical software, and working with communities to implement them (source: Unicef ).
A $1,000,000 investment would enable 10,000 nomadic children in Eritrea to go to school. This could include establishing new nomadic learning centres, expanding existing ones, and training teachers to enable the most marginalised children to access their right to a quality education for the long term (source: Unicef).
$3.2bn would feed the 66 million school-aged children who go hungry . Being well-nourished would give poorer children a far greater chance of getting an education and bringing themselves out of poverty through better paid work (source: Oxfam ).
Promotion of health
For $4bn, more than 12 million people could be provided with antiretroviral drugs  more than the total number of people living with HIV/Aids across the least developed countries. Alternatively, the money would pay for 190 million children to be fully vaccinated, saving more than 6 million lives (source: One campaign).
Spending $4bn on water and sanitation services would also go a long way to relieving a health crisis that kills 1,400 children every day (source: WaterAid ).
A $4bn investment would also build 666m basic pit latrines, or 111m improved latrines  which include a ventilation pipe and mesh to reduce odours  to serve 555 million people (source: WaterAid).
With $4bn, it would also be possible to reach as many as 167 million of the 179 million people living in the 17 countries worst off for access to clean water. Assuming there were no other obstacles, that means every person who right now lives without water in Angola , Chad , DRC, Guinea , Eritrea, Ethiopia , Haiti , Madagascar , Mauritania , Mozambique , Niger , Tanzania and Papua New Guinea (source: WaterAid).
Empowering women
Given that the median income of womens rights organisations worldwide is $20,000 a year, $4bn would fund 10,000 womens rights organisations for 20 years (source: Mama Cash ).

The slow unfolding of the sustainable development goals continued last month with the unveiling of the zero draft that will be negotiated in the runup to the summit in New York in September.
How does the draft of 17 goals look from the perspective of an organisation dedicated to helping countries to strengthen democracy? The answer is not bad, but not good.
Related: Albania makes headway in the battle against corruption
On the plus side, it is good that there is a goal 16 at all. The draft goal reads: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.
There was no equivalent in the millennium development goals (MDGs), and it is welcome that goal 16 includes a target of ensuring responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels.
I like all those words, which embody a commendable set of ambitions. The target of effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels is a good transposition of text from the UN high-level panel report on the post-2015 development agenda co-chaired by the presidents of Liberia and Indonesia and the British prime minister, which included all three adjectives.
On the minus side, there are two main gaps.
First, the word democracy itself has not been used, nor any variant such as democratic accountability. That is disappointing but not surprising, even though the Millennium Declaration , which formed the basis of the MDGs, did make specific calls for these conditions to be included.
Perhaps the word democracy is less popular than 15 years ago and it was blocked by the sensitivities of UN politics
My guess is that the word democracy, perhaps less popular now than it was 15 years ago, was blocked by the sensitivities of UN politics.
The second gap is the failure to address the key instruments of representative democracy, namely parliaments or political parties. Again, this is disappointing but not surprising. There is a presumption in the text that the executive are the main actors, rather than the representatives of citizens. Indeed, the high-level panel called for someone (implicitly governments) to grant rights (such as freedom of speech) to people, rather than for people to act to curb the powers of the executive.
So what should be the response of those interested in strengthening democracy? We need to do two things.
First, we should demystify democracy. Democracy is not a western plot, it is a universal value. Virtually all countries have aspects of democratic culture in place to some degree, and absolutely every country has room to strengthen the quality of their democracy.
I would like to build common ground about the aspects of democracy that are important regardless of region or political grouping. That would make work on achieving the targets in goal 16 much more useful.
Related: Nigeria's free and fair elections are an inspiration for nascent democracies | Kofi Annan
Second, the Millennium Declaration is still relevant when it says that we should work collectively for more inclusive political processes, allowing genuine participation by all citizens in all our countries. We should rebalance our thinking about national responsibilities, taking up that challenge of putting people and their representatives first. This links back to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . The central task of the declaration, and of the Magna Carta for that matter, was to curb the power of the executive  which, unchecked, tends to be abused.
In the vast majority of countries, we should look at the role of parliaments, the judiciary, civil society and the media, as well as the executive, when considering how to secure objectives encapsulated in goal 16.
A report by Civicus called for new forms of representation and oversight, such as citizens panels. Institutions should be tested on their ability to respond to and achieve progress on issues identified by people rather than just governments, it added.
The sentiment certainly reflects the level of concern many people feel about traditional representative institutions. Building common ground on what democracy means, and helping to improve the quality of representation in our countries, go hand in hand and are both worth pursuing.
Goal 16 is imperfect and is almost at the bottom of the list of proposed SDGs. But the glass is half full. Politics and the development community have been uncomfortable partners in many ways, and this is a chance to work together to help political systems do a better job. If we succeed, then we will have fulfilled the promise of the Millennium Declaration  citizens of all countries working together to put sustainable development at the centre of the agenda and hold governments to account for their actions.

Sir Fazle Hasan Abed, the founder of Brac , the largest non-governmental organisation on the planet, has been awarded the 2015 World Food prize for his unparalleled work on reducing poverty in Bangladesh and 10 other countries.
Abed established Brac  formerly known as the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee  in 1972 as a relief operation to help the country recover from its war of independence with Pakistan and the destruction wrought by a tropical cyclone.
The organisations focus soon switched to finding new ways to tackle poverty and empower women socially and economically, and it is estimated to have brought nearly 150 million people out of poverty since its foundation.
Today, it has a staff of 110,000 and works in 11 countries: Bangladesh, Afghanistan , Pakistan , the Philippines , Sri Lanka , Liberia , Sierra Leone , South Sudan , Tanzania , Uganda and Haiti .
Dr MS Swaminathan, chair of the World Food prize selection committee and the first World Food prize laureate in 1987, described Abed as a strategic thinker, and a man with a future vision. He also praised the NGO for its constant innovation and bold use of funding.
It's a great satisfaction for us to to receive recognition of the work weve done for the last 43 years
Fazle Hasan Abed
While funding was important, Abed realised that the organisation needed some internal financial resources in order to steer its course, rather than become diverted by donor agendas, he said.
He therefore set up a considerable number of commercial enterprises as part of the Brac brand. These include printing presses, manufacturing industries, a hotel, conference facilities, retail outlets and the private Brac University, among others. Surpluses from these enterprises go into supporting Bracs development programmes.
Abed, who was knighted by the Queen in 2010, described the award as a tremendous honour, adding: Im sure this will be a great joy for our staff and energise them even more. Its a great satisfaction for us to receive recognition of the work weve done for the last 43 years.
He said he was particularly proud of Bracs work on tackling child mortality in Bangladesh in the 1980s, which saw the number of deaths halved over a decade.
Brac's work on tackling child mortality in Bangladesh in the 1980s saw the number of deaths halved over a decade
We went to every household in Bangladesh teaching mothers how to make oral rehydration fluid at home to combat diarrhoeal deaths, he said. That also made it possible for Brac to become a very large organisation very quickly and to expand our programmes throughout the country.
Equally productive, he said, had been Bracs push to raise the rates of child immunisation in the last few years of the same decade. Between 1986 and 1990, the proportion of immunised Bangladeshi children rose from 2% to 70% . In the areas where Brac works, he added, the immunisation rate is now at 95%.
Abed said that although Bracs approach is multifaceted, it was founded on a simple principle.
We have worked on many different aspects of poverty: mortality reduction; maternal mortality and health; family planning; financial services for women; womens empowerment; agriculture, and all kinds of livelihoods for poor people so that they could come out of extreme poverty and malnutrition, he said.
Everything we did in Bangladesh we did with one focus: getting poor people out of poverty because we feel that poverty is dehumanising.
With the world preparing to adopt the sustainable development goals  which will replace the millennium development goals and set the global development agenda for the next 15 years  Abed called for a renewed focus on eliminating extreme poverty.
He said that Bracs work with the poorest 8% of Bangladeshis had shown that even the ultra-poor could be reached if sufficient resources and commitment were available. Bracs two-year programme, designed to help those who are too poor for microfinance loans, involves using grants, monthly stipends and health services to support families while they learn about making money and household budgeting.
The programme has since been rolled out in several countries  Ghana, Ethiopia, India, Pakistan, Honduras and Peru where it has also proved successful.
Taking people out of extreme poverty can be done but you need the commitment to do it in every country throughout the world, said Abed.
Thats the problem  do we have the commitment in every country to take the extreme poor out of their misery? Do we have good governance in every country? There are many factors that affect development and hopefully these will also be part of the sustainable development goals: good governance and the eradication of corruption from societies.

With education increasingly in the global spotlight, research must be undertaken to pinpoint the factors that cause girls to struggle or drop out

Schools have the potential to transform girls lives, unlocking the door to future opportunities, better health and greater autonomy. But in many places, schooling falls short of that aspiration.
In May, global educators gathered at the World Education Forum in Korea to agree on a post-2015 global education agenda. In June, the US first lady Michelle Obama visited the UK to help launch a UK/US partnership that will invest nearly $200m (128m) in supporting girls education in countries affected by conflict, starting with the Democratic Republic of the Congo .
Next week, global educators will gather again, this time in Norway at the Oslo summit on education for development . There, they will work to strengthen and renew political commitments on education and improving learning outcomes for children worldwide.
And in September, world leaders will gather at the UN general assembly in New York to adopt the sustainable development goals , which will replace the millennium development goals and shape the international development agenda until 2030.
Given this growing momentum, now is clearly the time to ensure global organisations are committed to using rigorous evidence to improve education.
Girls face more barriers to learning than boys, particularly around the time of puberty . Understanding the relationship between events in girls lives and their ability to succeed in school will be key to achieving not only the post-2015 education goals but arguably the other development goals as well.
Over the past 25 years, access to school has increased dramatically. The gender gap has narrowed. More girls than ever are in school, and they are staying in school longer. Even in the developing world, adolescent girls are more likely to be in school than out of school. We need to celebrate that success.
But as girls stay in education longer, the challenges they face outside school have the potential to disrupt their education. Factors including early pregnancy , sexually transmitted infections, child marriage and sexual and gender-based violence all pose challenges. Many girls are grappling with these issues today  and those in the education sector need to know how to respond.
For decades, the Population Council and others have been studying disparities in education  disparities between girls and boys, between the poorest and most vulnerable populations and those who are better off. We have looked at what works in girls education, and analysed what girls need to complete primary school, and to gain access to a high-quality, safe secondary school where they can complete their education. We have looked at how to ensure girls learn in school and go on to become healthy, productive adults.
One thing we have noticed is just how difficult it is to pinpoint what causes girls to struggle in school or to drop out during adolescence. So many life changes happen during this time. A lot can depend on where a girl lives, how she is doing in school, and what pressures her family is facing.
But while it is difficult to tease out the exact reasons girls leave school, its crucial that we do try, because the causes determine the solutions. Pregnancy and early marriage are not necessarily the only issues. We must look deeper at which girls are most likely to become pregnant, get married or leave school prematurely. For example, if a girls family is poor and unable or unwilling to pay school fees, she may not have the support she needs to continue her education. Her parents may decide marriage is a better option for her future security.
In 2009, we conducted a review of more than 300 adolescent girls education programmes from around the world. The study revealed that the majority of these programmes were not based on evidence and were not evaluated to demonstrate whether or not they were achieving their goals.
Of the 11 most common programme interventions for adolescent girls, only two having female teachers and providing financial help  had been proven to be effective.
Too often, the scarce resources invested in girls education are going to programmes that lack evidence-based proof of success. These programmes are not being rigorously evaluated to see if they help girls stay in school longer, retain skills, and live healthy, productive lives.
To reap the benefits for girls and societies, we need evidence, not just intuition, to guide our efforts. Donors and policymakers must commit to using evidence  about the problem and what works to address it  when developing policies and deciding on funding.
Donors and implementing organisations should hold themselves to high standards: let no programme be implemented or funded without a solid base of evidence behind it, or a significant commitment to evaluation within it.
As world leaders put the final touches to the post-2015 education goals, a commitment to rigorous evidence must be a top priority. We are heartened by the new US/UK investment in education, because the agreement includes a welcome commitment of 10m from the UK to build the evidence base around adolescent girls education. We encourage others to follow this example.

Less than one-quarter of Australias aid money is going to the worlds poorest nations, new analysis by aid organisation One has revealed.
About 22.7% of aid money goes to the least developed nations, with the Abbott government instead opting to focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Around 20% of the worlds poorest countries are in that region, with more than two-thirds in sub-Saharan Africa.
Australias aid budget has been slashed by $11bn over the last few years, and in the 2013-14 financial year, the country spent $4.7bn on development funding. Just 5% of that  $240m  went to sub-Saharan Africa. A further $713m went to other under-developed nations.
Nearly all jurisdictions received a cut to funding, as outlined in the 2014-15 May budget , but sub-Saharan Africa received one of the largest cuts, losing 70% of its funding.
Aid group One wants donor countries like Australia to adopt new goals for next weeks aid conference in Ethiopia.
The United Nations financing for development conference will plot out a financial pathway end extreme poverty by 2030, and is the last major aid meeting before the sustainable development goals are adopted in New York in September.
The new goals will replace the Millennium Development Goals, many of which fell by the wayside when the global financial crisis hit.
One said donor countries must commit to raising its aid funding to 0.7% of gross national income (GNI), of which 50% should go to the worlds least developed countries.
2015 could be a game changer for the worlds most vulnerable people, but decisions taken in Addis Ababa will determine whether the opportunity is seized or squandered, said Ones director of global policy, Eloise Todd. We wont see an end to extreme poverty unless countries like Australia shift focus to the poorest countries and the poorest people.
So far, the Abbott government has been historic for all the wrong reasons, overseeing cuts to the aid budget that have set Australia down the path to being the least generous its ever been in terms of aid , she said.
Australia currently spends 0.27% of GNI in aid. By contrast, Britain is one of the few countries to have met the 0.7% aid goal.
The US provides the most aid in terms of quantity, nudging $33bn in 2013-14. But by proportion the figure is low, representing 0.19% of GNI.
Both the US and Britain have increased their aid contribution to sub-Saharan Africa by more than 7% in one year.
One also wants donor countries to focus on aid programs that offer basic services like health and education, particularly for women, and urges recipient nations to strengthen anti-corruption measures so that aid money gets to the most vulnerable.
The managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, will give the keynote address at next weeks financing aid conference in Addis Ababa.
Labors foreign affiars spokeswoman, Tanya Plibersek , will be attending, while the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, was yet to confirm either way.
There are a number of foreign policy and security matters that the minister must attend to next week and she is currently finalising her schedule, a spokeswoman said.

In the final weeks of a tough, expensive re-election campaign for governor of Wisconsin, Scott Walker ran an advertisement that raised eyebrows on both sides of the culture war over abortion.
Hi, Im Scott Walker. Im pro-life, Walker says in the ad. But theres no doubt in my mind the decision of whether or not to end a pregnancy is an agonizing one. Thats why I support legislation to increase safety and to provide more information for a woman considering her options. The bill leaves the final decision to a woman and her doctor. Now, reasonable people can disagree on this issue. Our priority is to protect the health and safety of all Wisconsin citizens.
The ad aired in October, when polls showed him unpopular with female voters, with his challenger, Democrat Mary Burke, leading among women. This softer tone from a politician with a long record of rolling back access to abortions angered social conservatives, who were upset that Walker appeared to have abandoned his staunchly pro-life views. The shift also outraged reproductive rights activists, who said the ad was misleading to obscure his extreme stances on womens issues.
In the months since winning re-election, Walker, the son of a Baptist minister, has been under pressure to defend his record on opposing abortion and convince supporters that he is socially conservative enough to be the Republican nominee.
My policies throughout my career have earned a 100% rating with pro-life groups in Wisconsin, Walker wrote in an open letter in March . Just in my first term I signed numerous pieces of pro-life legislation and I will continue working for every life.
Since being elected governor in 2011, Walker has signed off on legislation requiring women seeking abortions to undergo ultrasounds , prohibiting the procedure from being covered by healthcare plans and defunding Planned Parenthood .
Now, days before he is expected to announce his candidacy for president, the Republican governor may get one more chance to reinforce his conservative credentials should a bill banning abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy land on his desk.

The Wisconsin bill, which is similar to legislation passed in 14 other states, is rooted in the belief that fetuses can feel pain at 20 weeks, a claim that has been disputed in medical research.
Walkers office confirmed on Wednesday that he plans to sign the bill if it passes the legislature.
But in the runup to his re-election last year, Walker had refused to take a stand on the ban. Pressed in an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in mid-October, he demurred.
He said late-term abortions raised some concerns and repeated that he believes a fetus is a human life. He then offered a hypothetical: what if my wife had been in a terrible car accident while pregnant with one of our sons and lost the baby, he asked rhetorically. You wouldnt send just a get-well card youd probably send a sympathy card to us because we lost that unborn child, he said.
To say one thing, when youre seeking the vote, get elected, then operate in a way thats completely antithetical to what you said when you were running, is incredibly frustrating, said Dayna Long, president of the Madison chapter of the National Organization for Women.
Its a betrayal and frankly I think it makes him a really untrustworthy politician.
Some critics say the ban was a calculated move by the governor to attract national conservatives.
Though he has repeatedly pledged his support for the bill, the governor has been more discreet about the genesis of the bill. The New York Times reported that Walker asked legislative leadership to deliver the bill to his desk during a meeting in his office earlier this year. A spokesman with the office of the state senate majority leader confirmed the report.
Wisconsin representative Chris Taylor, the former director of public policy for Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, who opposes the ban, said she has no doubt the ban is at least in some way a part of a broader political calculation.
Hell say anything to get elected, Taylor said. And this is a guy whos done a lot of devastating things for the women of the state.
Taylor said she is prepared to argue against the bill, which she called unconscionable, on Thursday, when the Wisconsin assembly is expected to vote. The state senate approved the bill in June on a party-line vote, with Republicans in favor, after a nearly three-hour debate.
The bill would prohibit abortions 20 weeks after conception. The bill provides some exemptions for women in medical emergencies, but not in cases of rape or incest.
Doctors and medical professionals who perform abortions could face criminal charges, punishable by $10,000 in fines or three and a half years in prison. The legislation also allows the father to sue the doctor for damages.
Supporters of the legislation says it protects womens health, because late-stage abortions can have more complications, as well as the fetuss.
It is undisputed that the risk to women from abortion increases with gestational age, said Mailee Smith, a staff attorney for Americans United for Life.
As such, bills limiting abortion at or after 20 weeks protect both womens lives as well as protect unborn children from the pain inflicted in later-term abortions, Smith added in a statement.
Abortions after 21 weeks of gestation are infrequent in the United States  nearly 99% of abortions in the US occur before 21 weeks, according to Planned Parenthood. The rate is similar in Wisconsin, where abortion clinics dont perform the procedure at that point in a pregnancy. (They are performed in hospitals in cases involving medical problems.) In 2013, just over 1%  89 out of 6,462  abortions were performed after 20 weeks of gestation, according to state figures.
But opponents of the 20-week bans say that the women who have abortions at this stage in their pregnancy often do so out of medical urgency. Abortions later in the pregnancy, reproductive rights activists say, are more likely to involve severe fetal abnormalities and serious risks to womens health.
Though the bill carves out exemptions for medical emergencies, women and their doctors have to meet a series of requirements that opponents say are too onerous before the procedure is allowed.
The Wisconsin bill is just the latest in a rash of bills seeking to ban abortion at or earlier than 20 weeks. Such bans challenge the fetal viability standard on abortions established by the 1973 US supreme court decision Roe v Wade, which legalized abortions. Fetal viability is generally believed to occur between 22 and 24 weeks.
Bans in Georgia, Idaho and Arizona have been struck down by courts. The ninth circuit court of appeals struck down the Arizona law in 2013, a decision the US supreme court declined to reconsider. In May, the same court found that Idahos law was unconstitutional.
Eleven other states have some version of the 20-week ban in place, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights research group. The US House also recently passed a bill banning abortion at 20 weeks, which includes an exemption for rape. Even if the bill were taken up and passed by the Senate, it would face a veto by President Barack Obama.
Voters and the public are becoming more attuned to the fact that these are all part of a nationwide scheme to ban abortion altogether,said Hayley Smith, an advocacy and policy associate at the American Civil Liberties Union.
They might hear about a 20-week ban this year, and next year they might hear about a bill to close abortion clinics in their state, she said. And over time they realize its not just one piece of legislation. Its a whole scheme of legislation designed to ban access altogether.

1 Cash
Greeks cannot withdraw more than 60  about 43  a day from cash machines. Cash is running out, with shortages of 5, 10 and 20 notes and 1 coins. Queues at cash machines are long.
2 Credit cards
Technically, cards are still accepted but many retailers only want cash; some offer discounts for cash. Greeks travelling abroad say they are having problems using cards issued by Greek banks, especially for big bills.
3 Money transfers
Transfers of money outside the country are banned without approval from a special committee, restricting imports and payments to exporters.
4 iPhone apps
People with iPhones report a block on downloading apps. Others who have subscription accounts to pay for iCloud storage received error messages when monthly direct debit fees were due.

5 PayPal
Greeks can receive Paypal payments but cannot spend. The company said capital controls meant funding of PayPal wallets from Greek bank accounts was currently not available.
6 Buy online
The ability to order goods and book services from websites that are based outside Greece  including Amazon.com or airlines such as easyJet  has become limited.
7 Buy or sell shares
The Athens stock exchange has been closed for seven days. It is scheduled to reopen on Thursday  but that prospect seems unlikely unless the banks are also able to resume trading.
8 Pay the rent
Restrictions on cash are making rent and bill payments difficult. Direct debit payments are apparently slowing and e-banking is creaking.
9 Shortages looming
Greek shoppers have been stocking up on staple items  such as coffee, pulses, rice, batteries and soap. Eggs and meat are also becoming more difficult to obtain, according to reports.
10 Pharmaceuticals
Almost all Greek drug supplies are imported and shortages of some essential drugs are reported. Greece owes international drug companies more than 1.1bn, according to an industry body.

Could Greece emulate Argentina's success after it defaulted in 2001?
After Argentina ended the pesos peg to the dollar, its economy collapsed. Yet five years on it was booming. Could that crisis provide a role model for Greece?

An economy in freefall. A run on the banks. Curbs on the amount of money that could be withdrawn from accounts. A team from the International Monetary Fund called back to Washington.
Greece in July 2015? No, this was Argentina in late 2001, when the currency peg between the peso and the dollar was coming under extreme pressure, and capital was leaving the country at an alarming rate.
Like Greece, Argentina was in a currency arrangement that was causing it extreme pain. Like Greece , Argentina had a stark choice: impose fresh budget cuts in the hope of remaining a hard currency; or cutting loose from the peg with a devaluation and debt default.
The parallels between Argentina and Greece are not exact; Argentina was never part of a single currency with the US. What it had was one-for-one convertibility so that the dollar and the peso were interchangeable. Argentina continued to issue its own currency, but used the peg to import anti-inflationary discipline from the US. When monetary policy was tightened in the US, it tightened in Argentina as well. When the dollar strengthened, so did the peso. By the end of the 1990s, Argentina had conquered inflation, but at the expense of driving the economy deep into recession and deep into debt.
Argentina under convertibility was a dry run for Greece in the single currency. Investor confidence rose as a result of the dollar peg and money came flooding into the country, prompting a lending boom. When the mood soured, money started to leave the country  at first in dribbles, but eventually in a flood. To stem the flows, restrictions were introduced that meant Argentines were only allowed to take 250 pesos (then 175) a week out of their accounts. Within six weeks, Argentina had announced a debt default and the end of convertibility.

The short-term impact on the economy was to turn recession into a slump. Argentinas national output collapsed by almost 11% in 2002 and unemployment rose sharply. Annual per capita income fell from $8,500 in the late 1990s to $2,800 in 2002, in large part due to the fall in the peso. The pain was, though, relatively short-lived and growth in the five years after the devaluation was stronger than in the five years that preceded it. Household incomes rose by 43% in five years.
Argentinas adjustment was aided by five factors. First, it already had its own currency and thus avoided the disruption that Greece would face if it returned to the drachma.
Second, it had commodity exports that were in high demand during an upswing dominated by Chinas arrival as a global economic superpower. For Greece, the outlook is not as good. World trade is growing more slowly than it was in the early 2000s, and the Greek economy is dominated by tourism and shipping.
Third, Argentina had been forced to keep interest rates high in order to maintain the dollar peg. When convertibility was abandoned, borrowing costs no longer had to be kept so high and came down sharply. Interest rates in the eurozone are currently at 0.05%.
Fourth, Argentinas deep recession meant it could expand rapidly for a number of years without running into inflationary difficulties. This meant it reaped the benefits of devaluation in its international competitiveness. Greece, too, has ample spare capacity. Its economy has contracted by a quarter and unemployment is 25%.
Finally, devaluation allowed Argentina to write off a chunk of its debts, which fell from 125% of GDP to 72% of GDP by 2005. Again, this would be an option for Greece were it to leave the eurozone.
Those who think Greece would be better off outside the single currency say Athens should heed the experience of Argentina, even though Latin Americas second-biggest economy has subsequently run into serious economic problems, with weak growth and high inflation.
Andrew Kenningham, senior global economist at Capital Economics , said: While no two economies are the same, there are clear parallels between Greece today and the economies that fared best after currency crises. Greece is suffering from a high level of spare capacity, tight credit conditions and a heavy public sector debt burden denominated in a currency against which it may not devalue.
This suggests that, once the dust settles, Greece would be well placed to see a sharp rebound in confidence and a period of rapid GDP growth if it left the eurozone. This would not, of course, solve Greeces economic problems forever, as Argentinas and Russias experiences also amply demonstrate. But it would lead to a brighter outlook than struggling on within the monetary union.

Bill Cosby scandal is the latest chapter in quaaludes' controversial history
Originally developed as an anti-malarial, the drug gained an exclusive cachet for enthusiasts after production ended in the 1980s but also has more nefarious uses

What are quaaludes, exactly? The drug, referred to in pop culture everywhere from Watchmen to The Wolf of Wall Street, is particularly rare  and thus particularly desired by some. Now its back in the news for one of the worst reasons imaginable: Bill Cosby has admitted giving it to a woman he wanted to sleep with.
Related: Bill Cosby: court documents open window into legal problems
Quaaludes werent always this infamous. When The Wolf of Wall Street came out, it featured an almost 15-minute-long sequence in which Leonardo DiCaprios character, the real-life stock market swindler Jordan Belfort, collapses into incoherence and nearly watches his best friend choke to death, all under the influence of several celebratory Lemmon 714 quaaludes. On the drug, the film, set in the late 80s seemed to say, you dont make any sense, but youre having the best time.
Angela Serratore wrote in the Paris Review last year that everyone who talked to her about enjoying the film included a half-whispered, wide-eyed aside: What exactly are quaaludes, and where can we get some?
Methaqualone was first synthesized in India in 1955 by scientists trying to find a cure for malaria. The drug was ineffective against the disease, but not as a central nervous system depressant  and if a user could resist its sedative effects, a user could get high.
Its makers were distressed to hear this: just before it was banned, Lemmon, the manufacturer of the drug that used the name Quaalude in the early 1980s, spent a lot of manpower writing letters to editors demanding corrections when they referred to illegally manufactured methaqualone by their brand name.
Lemmon lawyer Elliot Fisher told the AP in 1981 that the company knew about the illegal market for the drug, but didnt mind. [W]e considered it an excellent sleeping pill and it still is today, he said. Ultimately, the FDA disagreed. (Fisher was probably even less happy with the other slang name for quaaludes: lemons.)
The drug is expensive to manufacture and thus is effectively out of print since it was moved to the Controlled Substances Acts schedule I, alongside heroin and cocaine, in 1984. Lemmon had already stopped making them the previous year because of all the lousy press. Part of quaaludes appeal for its users is simple snobbery  theyre hard to get, and using them makes you part of an exclusive club.
But the drug also has a history of being used on the unwilling that predates the accusations against Cosby. Long before Rohypnol hit the market, quaaludes were a predators drug of choice, in part because its effect intensifies with alcohol. In 1977, when Roman Polanski was convicted of having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl, the victim testified that he used champagne and part of a quaalude to keep her from resisting.
Like any drug thats expired, decades-old quaaludes can lose their potency or develop a delay, but that doesnt stop people from trying them, even recently. On recreational drug boards, there are stories of people trying the substance and congratulatory messages from fellow enthusiasts when they come up. The stories are sometimes anticlimactic, however.
Welll completely backed [sic] out on those Ludes last night, dont know how I got home,but I woke up fully clothed with a quarter oz of weed I dont know how I got, all over my chest wrote one user called Jman6181 on drug forum BlueLight . I got paper wrist bands from bars so I now I went out...wtf.
My friend said I literally got physically tossed from a bar because I was kept calling the bartender Magilla, and demanding a Mojo which is a drink that doesnt exist.

        <title>Tsipras and Merkel: polar opposites who depend entirely on each other</title>

They are a study in contrasts, the yin and the yang of Europes epic battle for mastery of its destiny. But Angela Merkel and Alexis Tsipras are now almost umbilically linked  the political fate of the one hinging on the policy choices of the other.
Related: Greek debt crisis: Emergency summit begins - live updates
Going into yet another emergency Brussels summit of EU leaders on Tuesday evening, the German chancellor and the Greek prime minister were the main protagonists in a meeting called to decide whether Greece stays in the euro.
The leaders wanted to hear what Tsipras wanted and how Merkel would respond. Buoyed by his victorious gamble in Sundays Greek referendum, Tsipras was under intense pressure to make up his mind and deliver an offer with prospects. Stunned by the boldness of the referendum call and defeated by its outcome, Merkel was under strong domestic pressure not to give further ground.
The space between them and whether it can be bridged is the main factor determining whether Greece is pulled back from the brink of isolation, financial collapse and social implosion, or whether Europe faces one of its biggest collective failures by casting Greece out of the euro.
The Greek and the German are locked in a battle of wills and nerves in which the stakes could not be higher, both for their countries and their own careers.
Merkel created Tsipras. Were it not for five years of wrenching German-scripted austerity in Greece, the leftist radical could not have dreamed of becoming prime minister in January.
But if she made his political career, he now has a big say in settling her political legacy. Whether Merkel goes down in history as the German chancellor who presided over the breakup of the euro by allowing its irreversibility to be shown to be a sham also depends on Athens.
The leaders could hardly be more different. It has fallen to Merkel to save Europe. Tsipras wants to change Europe. It is a fundamental clash of conservatism versus radicalism. Locked in a form of mutual dependency, both can succeed only in relative terms.
Tsipras is of the far left and has been engaged in firebrand politics since his teenage days. Merkel is of the centre right and shunned politics almost entirely until the Berlin Wall fell, opening up opportunities for a shy, middle-aged scientist living in East Germany .
He is a gambler. She is risk averse. He professes to be a visionary and a missionary. She eschews grand schemes, preferring the virtues of modesty, patience, and self-deprecation. For Tsipras, the end seems to justify the means. For Merkel, the means are the main thing: it is seldom clear what her end might be.
Tsipras is criticised as a populist, even a demagogue. Merkel has an acute nose for public opinion and popular sentiment, but could never be accused of ranting.
What they have in common is a tendency towards pragmatism, the ruthlessness common in national leaders and degrees of inscrutability which make it difficult to gauge where they will bend and where they will refuse to compromise.
In 10 years in office that have become synonymous with the euro crisis and made the German chancellor the single most indispensable leader in Europe, Merkel has seen off five Greek prime ministers. In less than six months in office, Tsipras has, in certain ways, proved to be the most formidable of the six she has faced.
When George Papandreou concluded bailout negotiations with the eurozone in 2011 by calling a referendum, Merkel co-plotted his downfall. He went and there was no plebiscite. When Antonis Samaras pleaded with her for help last year on many of the same austerity measures Tsipras is resisting, she spurned him, kept up the pressure and told him to get lost. Samaras then authored his own political crisis and lost office, too. This week, following Tsiprass referendum win, Samaras resigned as leader of the centre right.
Related: Eurozone tells Greece not to expect debt relief any time soon
But through five months of negotiations with Merkel and the others in the eurozone, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund, Tsipras has redefined the art of political brinkmanship. He has yet to blink, even if that means ruin for his country.
Ten days ago, in Brussels, he met Merkel privately, gave no clue of his intentions, attended yet another summit and then returned home. At midnight, out of the blue, he set alarm bells ringing across Europe by calling the referendum.
But Merkel, too, is perfectly capable of pulling a fast one with chilling single-mindedness. These climactic weeks that are so important to both leaders started late on a Monday evening five weeks ago.
On 1 June, Merkel suddenly summoned a quartet of creditors leaders to a late night mini-summit in her office in Berlin. She told neither her finance minister, Wolfgang Schuble, or Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the eurozone finance ministers committee. Instead, the quartet joining Merkel  the French president, Francois Hollande, Christine Lagarde, the head of the IMF, Mario Draghi, the president of the ECB, and Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European commission  decided to force a finale on the Greek crisis by producing a five-page aide-memoire dictating the austerity measures Tsipras would need to accept if he wanted to keep being funded by the eurozone.
It was an ultimatum from Merkel to Tsipras. Everything in the past five weeks flowed from that meeting in the Berlin chancellery. The final outcome was being plotted in Brussels on Tuesday night, with Tsipras proposing and Merkel determining the course of events.
They have never needed one another so much.

        <title>Colony, state or independence: Puerto Rico's status anxiety adds to debt crisis</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/07/puerto-rico-statehood-sovereign-rights-debt-crisis</Link>

The word colony conjures images of conquistadors and pilgrims, slavery and imperialism. But in Puerto Rico the supposed anachronism slips into daily conversations about the unstable present and an uncertain future.
Since the April day in 1899 when Americans formally took over the island, Puerto Ricans have felt uneasy about their status within the United States.
Related: Puerto Rico's 'unpayable' debt: is this the Greece of the western hemisphere?
And as the island faces a debt crisis that has cratered its economy and sent its leaders to Washington to plead for more sovereign powers, the issue has taken on a new urgency.
Unique among US territories, Puerto Rico has a state-like government but is not a state: it draws all its authorities from Washington DC and is restricted in ways states are not. The islands ports can only do business with US ships, for instance, and the territory depends heavily on federal aid.
Most pressingly, however, the island lacks authority to either file for bankruptcy or restructure its $72bn municipal debt.
Governor Alejandro Garca Padilla argues that in its current form the debt is unpayable and that greater austerity will exacerbate already difficult living conditions . Padilla has stopped short of endorsing statehood, instead trying to focus on limited new powers.
But other politicians have been bolder. In April, Republican presidential frontrunner Jeb Bush endorsed statehood for Puerto Rico , the homeland of tens of thousands of recent migrants to Florida, the former governors home state.
Puerto Rican citizens ought to have the right to determine whether they want to be a state, he said. I think statehood is the best path, personally. To get the full benefits and responsibilities of citizenship, being a state is the only way to make that happen.
Proponents of statehood argue that its a simple matter of fairness. The islands Democratic delegate in Congress, Pedro Pierluisi , introduced a bill in February that could make Puerto Rico a state by 2021 should a majority of Puerto Ricans vote for statehood  as 61% did in a non-binding referendum in 2012.
One of the top fundraisers for Barack Obamas presidential campaigns, Andrs Lpez, has argued that the status quo is not only unequal but unsustainable.
Related: Cuba-US thaw brings fate of cold war-era fugitives on the island into focus
But the issue has found virtually no traction in Congress, and even appeals over bankruptcy powers have divided the House.
Many Puerto Ricans are skeptical of statehood, saying formal inclusion in the union would do almost nothing to ameliorate pressing issues of unemployment, healthcare and housing.
Antonio Cuarro, a shop owner in Ro Piedras, said the debate amounted to empty rhetoric. Each government just uses one side or the other to get elected, he said. Its all the same.
San Juan legislator Luis Gallardo agreed, saying the campaign exists only in the imagination of our statehood politicians. A lot of people have tried to piggyback on the issue.
Gallardo said he was ambivalent: I dont know whats worse, not having federal bankruptcy powers or having federal income taxes on top of the highest local taxes in the country.
Others balked at becoming the 51st state. Attorney Manuel Rodriguez said statehood could help Puerto Ricans with access to the justice system, bankruptcy options and federal intervention, but its no magic solution and would not necessarily mean progress. Theres also no chance it will happen, given Congress.
Statehood is wrong for Puerto Rico because Puerto Rico is a nation. We consider ourselves Puerto Ricans, not Americans
Senator Ramn Nieves
A minority tapped into long-simmering nationalism and suggested more drastic changes  not quite the violent separatism of the 1960s and 70s, but a crusade for greater independence nonetheless.
Statehood is wrong for Puerto Rico because Puerto Rico is a nation, said senator Ramn Nieves. We consider ourselves Puerto Ricans, not Americans.
What Puerto Rico needs is more powers in its relationship with the US, and eventually a new relationship with the US.
Nieves said Puerto Rico should follow the model of the Marshall Islands, which entered into a compact association with the US in order to retain some rights but also to move toward sovereign nationhood.
We value our history and relationship with the US  thousands of Puerto Ricans have died in foreign wars for a century  but the traditional options of statehood or independence dont help us right now, he said.
Washington has done close to nothing to help, Nieves said, suggesting exemptions from trade restrictions, or guarantees on some bonds: The Treasury always says it will provide technical assistance but that doesnt mean anything.
I dont mean that they should hand us a check for $72bn, but if they cannot be a little more active or willing to help us, they should give us the tools to help ourselves.
Sovereignty is not the same as independence, Nieves concluded. All independent nations are sovereign, but not all sovereign nations are independent.
In casual conversation many Puerto Ricans refer to the territory as a country, and occasionally as a colony. Monuments to Spanish and Latin American history and culture dominate San Juan: Miguel de Cervantes, Juan Ponce de Len and Simon Bolvar all stand tall in the city. References to the US are rarer: a statue of Abraham Lincoln in the old city, the outposts of federal agencies and tourists.
The relationship with the US has aggravated our problems, said Ataveyra Hernndez, a former adviser to the governor. Puerto Ricans are hugely dependent on the government, which depends on federal money. Its a structural problem, and theres an urgent need to renegotiate the relationship.
The Caribbean is full of countries that are small just like us, and they control their own destinies, their resources, their policies.
The Caribbean is full of countries just like us, and they control their own destinies, their resources, their policies
Ataveyra Hernandez
But with constant movement to and from the mainland, the close ties of families, and a continuing military presence on the island, emotional ties to the US remain strong for Puerto Ricans born on both shores. Both flags dot homes in San Juan.
Some view the question of independence more dispassionately. A metro employee at the Ro Piedras stop simply waved her hand toward the desolate plaza nearby.
Look at where we are, she said. Were not ready for that, no way.
In practical terms, Puerto Ricans already enjoy most of the same perks as other Americans, including US passports and billions in welfare from the federal government, though their semi-autonomous government is restricted by and depends heavily on the US. They cannot vote for president and lack a congressional representative who can vote outside of House committees.
But new arrivals to the US who change their residency will be able to vote in the 2016 presidential election, and they could potentially sway key states such as Florida.

In an arty cinema at the end of the 60s I watched Costa-Gavrass stylish political thriller Z which satirised the brutal military regime then ruling Greece . When the film ended the audience enthusiastically applauded, something I had never previously seen in a cinema, and have rarely seen since.
As Europes acknowledged home of political philosophy and practice, Greece of the hated military dictatorship had a special place in the hearts of many Europeans, as it did for Lord Byron when he went off to fight (and die) for Greek independence in 1824. This weekends Solidarity with Greece demonstrations, in small villages as well as major cities, shows it still does.
In its showdown with creditors, the Greek government of Alexis Tsipras exploits this romantic attachment. And why not? Small countries have to use the assets at their disposal in a big world.
But sentiment alone is rarely an adequate guide to action, is it? The Greeks have a case against the counter-productive and excessive severity imposed on them by their creditors. But the creditors also have a case against the Greeks.
Foreigners did not make their government fiddle the entry qualifications to join the eurozone, rack up debts or force citizens to evade their taxes, unless you count the legacy of the rackety Ottoman empire which ruled Greece from 1453 to 1821.
But the very concept of Greece has always been both powerful and fragile, its existence more usually sustained by foreign or domestic tyranny than by sophisticated philosophies from the 4th and 5th centuries BC. Disunity and rebellion have also been characteristic features of Greek politics and identity.
After defeating successive invasions launched by the mighty Persian empire at Marathon (490BC), at Thermopylae (sort of), at Salamis, Plataea and Mycale, did not the Greek city states soon succumb to civil war which ended in Athenss defeat by militaristic Sparta? Yes.
And so it went on. Domination by Macedonia meant that the spread of Greek culture across the Mediterranean  previously led by the soft power of trade and settlement  was expanded east and south by the conquests of Alexander the Great (356BC to 323BC). The Romans later conquered, but deferred (though captured, Greece took its wild conqueror capture, wrote Horace the poet) to the Greeks, much as the Americans did towards Britain for a while. We are the Greeks to their Romans, the future PM, Harold Macmillan, once told a colleague.
In the western Roman empire Rome duly fell (476AD) to barbarian invasions. The eastern half, though battered, morphed into the Christian Byzantine empire which staggered on, a Greek entity, for 1,000 years before Constantinople finally fell to the Muslim Ottomans after the great siege of 1453.
Does any of this matter to the bean counters in Brussels or Berlin this summer? It should.
So should the bean borrowers of Athens acknowledge that German fear of excessive debt and a debauched currency is rooted in troubled German history, the Weimar Republic which led to the Nazi coup, and the fragility of a national identity ravaged by the brutal thirty years war (1618-48).
When Greece restored national sovereignty and unity in 1832, Germany was still 40 years away from doing the same.
If Greeks see themselves as victims, so do Germans, who have picked up the bill to rescue East Germany well within living memory and widely resented it (but they were at least fellow Germans).
This is psychologically risky territory as Angela Merkel and her advisers decide what Germany  and the EU  must do to rescue Greece from its own brinkmanship and save Europe from its lackadaisical management of the crisis.
Germans picked up the bill to rescue East Germany and widely resented it (but they were at least fellow Germans)
But rebellion comes more naturally to Greeks than to Germans who have often traded liberty for security, not always wisely, but understandable with fluid frontiers which an island people like us should gratefully acknowledge.
In the Ottoman centuries the Greeks had an instinct to side with the Caliphs enemies, rising in revolt many times and usually being hammered for their pains. The fact that Venetian Corfu remained free and prosperous and that Crete held out until 1670 (the long siege was a fashionable cause for years) only fed an appetite for defiance which broke into open, ultimately successful revolt in 1821. Cue Lord Byron.
Two further points are worth registering here.
Greeces successive 19th- and 20th-century wars to regain its historic territory, usually involving neighbouring Turkey (as the Ottoman successor state became after defeat in the first world war), were bloody, traumatic affairs. We hear a lot about the Turkish Armenian massacres (were they genocide?), less about the one million Greeks living abroad (resident for centuries) who may have died during waves of displacement and expulsion from Asia Minor. In invading Turkey in 1919, Greece was a part-author of its own misfortune: it lost.
None of this is good for people. Greece had rival governments, once pro-German, once pro-British, during the first world war and remained divided during the inter-war years. Greeks fought like tigers against the invading Italians in 1940 who had to be rescued by the Germans. Even Hitler acknowledged the courage of the Greek resistance which continued long after defeat.

But the German occupation was savage, both to Greeks and their economy. Many starved. Worse, the European peace of 1945 was followed by the Greek civil war of 1946 to 1949 in which Britain and the US backed the Greek government and the Greek communists were backed by Titos government in next-door Yugoslavia.
Stalin had agreed to leave Greece in the western sphere of influences in his percentages agreement with Churchill at the Kremlin in 1944. He just forgot to tell the Greek comrades. After yet another savage war, they lost, Greece joined Nato  much as it did the EU in 1981 after the Greek colonels were ousted when again the Turks invaded Cyprus (1974)  and Greek democracy was restored.
So the divided legacy of modern Greece remains and is vivid well within living memory  royalist and republican, left and right, urban and rural. The Syriza coalition, led by Tsipras, represents the defeated side in the civil war as Tsipras, a youthful communist of bourgeois stock, explicitly acknowledged in gestures made when he became prime minister in January.
Geographical determinists, the people who argue we are primarily shaped by our environment, might argue that a country with Europes longest coastline  more than 8,000 miles and 2,000 islands (mostly unpopulated)  is bound to be fractious.
In one of his Outliers essays, Malcolm Gladwell, made the point differently when he argued that herdsmen who tend sheep and goats on marginal land  in Greece, Sicily, Ireland or Tennessee  have to have short fuses or their neighbours will steal their animals. Hence the importance of the blood feud which persists. Arable farmers dont have them, its harder to steal wheat.
Be that as it may, Tsipras has his new mandate to negotiate with Brussels and Berlin on an emphatic 60% no vote from a deeply divided nation. Its not hard to see how things could get nasty quickly. And remember, those Germans feel hard done by and put upon too.
